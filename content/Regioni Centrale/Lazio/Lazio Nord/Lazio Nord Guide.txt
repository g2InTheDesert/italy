    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Lazio Nord’s history is a saga of ancient tribes, papal power, and rural resilience, beginning with Etruscan settlements around 900 BC.

    <p>The fall of Rome in 476 AD led to Lombard rule, who fortified villages like Viterbo.<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup> The Middle Ages saw Viterbo as a papal seat in the 13th century, hosting popes during conflicts with Rome, and the construction of the Palazzo dei Papi.<sup><a href="#cite-28">28</a></sup> The Renaissance brought artistic growth, with painters like Signorelli working in nearby Orvieto. The Papal States controlled Lazio Nord until the 19th century, with reforms improving agriculture in Nepi.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>The Risorgimento led to unification in 1870, with Lazio joining the Kingdom of Italy after Viterbo’s integration.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century brought industrialization in Viterbo, but rural areas like San Lorenzo Nuovo remained agricultural.

The Renaissance fostered artistic growth, with Montefiascone’s cathedral dome influencing regional architecture.<sup><a href="#cite-28">28</a></sup> The 18th-century papal rule brought land reforms, improving yields near Capodimonte. The 19th-century unification introduced infrastructure like the Viterbo-Rome railway.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century saw Lazio Nord’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans using the hills around Castel Sant’Angelo for guerrilla warfare. The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Viterbo, while rural areas like Celleno focused on olive oil. Recent preservation efforts, like the Lake Bolsena environmental projects, highlight ecological history <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. Lazio Nord’s history, marked by cultural depth and rural continuity, continues to define its identity.</p>
