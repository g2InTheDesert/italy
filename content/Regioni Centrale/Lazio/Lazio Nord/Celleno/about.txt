<p>Celleno, a near-deserted hilltop village in northern Lazio, is dubbed the “Ghost Village” for its abandoned medieval core, rivaling Civita di Bagnoregio. Its crumbling castle and Chiesa di San Donato overlook the Tiber Valley, while eerie alleys attract explorers. Slowly reviving, Celleno hosts summer festivals celebrating local olive oil and chestnuts. Its haunting atmosphere, coupled with proximity to Lake Bolsena, makes Celleno a fascinating stop for those seeking Lazio’s hidden, melancholic treasures.</p>
