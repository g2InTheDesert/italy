<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Celleno’s history is a rich narrative of Etruscan origins, medieval prosperity, and modern abandonment, shaped by its strategic hilltop location in the Tuscia region. Founded by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, Celleno was a fortified settlement, leveraging its position above the Tiber Valley for trade and defense. Archaeological finds, including pottery and tombs near the village, attest to its early significance, with the Etruscans using the area’s volcanic tuff for construction <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Celleno, then known as Cellanum, thrived as an agricultural and trading hub along the Via Cassia, with villas and aqueducts supporting its economy. The fall of the Roman Empire brought invasions by Goths and Lombards, but Celleno’s defensible position ensured its survival. By the 11th century, it emerged as a medieval commune, with the Orsini family constructing the Castello Orsini, a fortress that became the village’s centerpiece. The castle, with its robust walls and towers, protected Celleno during conflicts between papal states and neighboring powers <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Celleno flourish, but natural disasters began to shape its fate. Epidemics in the 17th century, followed by landslides and a devastating earthquake in 1931, led to the gradual abandonment of the old village. Residents relocated to the new town, built in the 1930s, leaving Celleno Vecchia a ghost village <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. During World War II, Celleno was the site of the first battle involving South African troops in Italy, a skirmish in 1944 that left minimal damage but added a modern historical layer <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In the 20th century, efforts to preserve Celleno Vecchia began, with restoration projects in the 2000s stabilizing the castle and key buildings. The village’s designation as a cultural site has attracted artists and historians, with recent initiatives aiming for UNESCO recognition <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. Bagnoregio’s success with Civita inspired Celleno’s tourism model, with guided tours and exhibits highlighting its medieval past. Celleno’s history, from Etruscan ingenuity to modern revival, is a testament to its enduring allure.</p>
