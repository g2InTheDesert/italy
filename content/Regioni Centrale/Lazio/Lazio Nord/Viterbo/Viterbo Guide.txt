    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Viterbo’s history spans over 3,000 years, from Etruscan origins to its medieval prominence as a papal stronghold. Founded as an Etruscan settlement around the 8th century BC, Viterbo (possibly from *Vicus Elbium*) was a fortified center, with archaeological finds like tombs and pottery near the Bullicame springs evidencing its early prosperity. The Etruscans engineered water channels, laying the foundation for Viterbo’s thermal heritage <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Viterbo, known as Vicus Elbium, thrived along the Via Cassia, with aqueducts and villas supporting its economy. After the empire’s fall, it was conquered by the Lombards in the 8th century, becoming part of the Duchy of Spoleto. By the 11th century, Viterbo emerged as a free commune, with the Cattedrale di San Lorenzo as its religious center. Its strategic position made it a papal stronghold, with the Palazzo dei Papi built in 1257 under Pope Alexander IV. The palace hosted six conclaves, cementing Viterbo’s nickname “City of the Popes” <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Viterbo flourish, with the Quartiere San Pellegrino developing as a medieval hub. In 1367, Pope Urban V fortified the city against Ghibelline attacks. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with artists like Antonio del Massaro painting frescoes in the cathedral. In 1527, Viterbo supported Pope Clement VII during the Sack of Rome, reinforcing its papal ties <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Viterbo join unified Italy in 1870, with industrial growth in the 20th century, including the bottling of Bullicame springs.</p>

    <p>World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting nearby rail lines. Post-war restoration preserved the medieval core, and recent efforts have revitalized sites like the Papal Palace and thermal baths, boosting tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Viterbo’s history, from Etruscan ingenuity to papal prominence, underscores its enduring cultural significance.</p>
