<p>Viterbo, Lazio’s “City of Popes,” is a medieval marvel with its intact 13th-century walls and Palazzo dei Papi, a former papal residence. The San Pellegrino quarter, a perfectly preserved medieval district, and the Romanesque Duomo di San Lorenzo enchant visitors. Known for its thermal baths, like Terme dei Papi, and dishes like lombrichelli pasta, Viterbo hosts the Santa Rosa festival with a towering “Macchina.” Viterbo’s history, charm, and proximity to Rome make it a cultural gem.</p>
