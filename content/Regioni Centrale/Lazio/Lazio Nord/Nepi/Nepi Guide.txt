<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Nepi’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins as one of the Faliscan people’s major centers, known as Nepe or Nepet. Founded around the 7th century BC, Nepi was a fortified settlement due to its strategic position on a tuff cliff, surrounded by gorges and springs. Archaeological finds, including tombs and bronze artifacts at the Necropoli di Sasso Pizzuto, evidence its Etruscan prosperity, with the Via Amerina facilitating trade with Rome and Falerii <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. The Etruscans engineered underground channels to harness Nepi’s springs, laying the foundation for its “City of Waters” moniker.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Nepi became Nepet, a key colony after its conquest in 396 BC during the wars with the Faliscans. The Romans built aqueducts, roads, and villas, with the Via Cassia nearby boosting its economy. Nepi’s springs supplied water to Rome, and its port on the Tiber River supported trade <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. After the Roman Empire’s fall, Nepi was invaded by Goths and Byzantines, but its defensible position ensured survival under Lombard rule in the 6th century.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Nepi emerge as a free commune, with the Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta as its religious center. In the 15th century, the Borgia family, under Pope Alexander VI, fortified the Rocca, making Nepi a papal stronghold. The fortress withstood sieges during conflicts with neighboring powers, including a notable attack by the French in 1499 <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 16th century brought the aqueduct’s construction, a masterpiece of engineering by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, ensuring a steady water supply <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In 1798, French troops destroyed parts of Nepi, including the cathedral, which was rebuilt in the 19th century. Nepi joined unified Italy in 1870, with its springs supporting a bottling industry. World War II caused minor damage, but post-war restoration preserved the medieval core. Recent efforts to restore the Rocca Borgia and aqueduct have boosted tourism, with initiatives for UNESCO recognition inspired by nearby Civita di Bagnoregio <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. Nepi’s history, from Etruscan ingenuity to Renaissance fortification, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
