<p>Nepi, a historic town in Lazio’s Viterbo province, is known as the “City of Water” for its springs and aqueducts. Its imposing Rocca dei Borgia, tied to Lucrezia Borgia, and the Romanesque Duomo dominate the skyline, while Etruscan caves lie beneath. Nepi’s mineral water and local specialties like gnocchi al castrato draw foodies. Surrounded by ravines and greenery, Nepi’s blend of history, nature, and cuisine makes it a compelling stop near Rome.</p>
