<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Capodimonte’s history is a captivating journey through Etruscan, Roman, and medieval eras, shaped by its strategic position on Lake Bolsena. Originally an Etruscan settlement, the area was a hub for fishing and trade by the 6th century BC, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near Bisentina Island evidencing its early prosperity. The Etruscans revered the lake as sacred, associating it with their goddess Voltumna <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Capodimonte, then known as Caput Mundi, thrived as a fishing and agricultural center, with villas built along the lake. The Roman road Via Cassia, passing nearby, facilitated trade, and remnants like bridges are still visible. The fall of the Roman Empire brought invasions, but Capodimonte’s defensible position on a promontory ensured its survival under Byzantine and Lombard rule <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The medieval period saw Capodimonte’s rise under the Farnese family, who constructed the Rocca Farnese in the 16th century as a defensive stronghold. The fortress, designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, protected the village during regional conflicts between papal states and neighboring duchies. The Farnese also patronized churches, including Santa Maria Assunta, enhancing Capodimonte’s religious significance <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In the 17th century, Capodimonte came under papal control, with the lake’s resources supporting Rome’s economy. The 19th century unification of Italy integrated Capodimonte into the province of Viterbo, and its fishing industry flourished. World War II spared the village major damage, preserving its medieval core. Today, archaeological efforts continue, with recent discoveries of Etruscan artifacts near the lake, displayed in the Museo della Navigazione, reinforcing Capodimonte’s historical legacy.</p>
