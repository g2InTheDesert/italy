<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Orte’s history is a compelling narrative of Etruscan ingenuity, Roman prosperity, and medieval resilience, shaped by its strategic location in the Tiber Valley. Founded by the Etruscans around the 7th century BC as Horta, Orte was a key settlement due to its position along the Tiber River and proximity to the Via Amerina, an ancient trade route. Archaeological evidence, including tombs and pottery near the Orte Scalo area, confirms its Etruscan prominence, with the underground tunnels showcasing advanced hydraulic engineering <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Etruscans fortified the hilltop, making Horta a defensive stronghold.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Orte, renamed Hortae, thrived as a commercial and military hub. The Via Cassia, connecting Rome to northern Italy, passed nearby, and Roman bridges over the Tiber, some still visible, facilitated trade. Orte’s port on the river supported its economy, with villas and aqueducts built in the surrounding countryside <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. After the Roman Empire’s fall, Orte was invaded by Goths and Byzantines, but its defensible position ensured survival under Lombard rule in the 6th century <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Orte emerge as a free commune by the 10th century, with its medieval walls and towers, like the <strong>Torre di San Giorgio</strong>, still standing. The town aligned with the Papal States, serving as a strategic outpost against neighboring powers. In 1208, Pope Innocent III fortified Orte, and its role as a papal ally continued through the Renaissance, with the Palazzo Roberteschi built as a noble residence <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>. The 14th century brought conflicts, including a siege by the Ghibellines, but Orte’s fortifications held firm.</p>

    <p>The 17th century saw the cathedral’s reconstruction, reflecting Baroque influences, while the 19th century integrated Orte into unified Italy in 1870. World War II brought strategic importance to Orte’s railway junction, with Allied bombings in 1944 causing minor damage to the modern town but sparing the historic core <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent restoration efforts, including the Orte Sotterranea and Palazzo Roberteschi, have revitalized the town’s historical legacy, with initiatives for UNESCO recognition inspired by nearby Civita di Bagnoregio <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>. Orte’s history, from Etruscan tunnels to modern preservation, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
