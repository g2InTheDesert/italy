<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Montefiascone’s history spans over 2,500 years, from Etruscan origins to papal prominence and modern revival. The town’s name derives from the Falisci (Mons Faliscorum, “Mountain of the Falisci”), a pre-Etruscan people, though some suggest it occupies the site of the Etruscan Fanum Voltumnae, a temple where the 12 Etruscan cities met. Archaeological evidence, including pottery and tombs near Lake Bolsena, confirms Etruscan settlement by the 6th century BC <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>. Under Roman rule, Montefiascone, near the Via Cassia, thrived as an agricultural and trade hub, with villas and aqueducts supporting its economy <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages marked Montefiascone’s rise as a papal stronghold. First documented in 853 AD as property of the Bishop of Tuscania, it gained prominence when Popes Stephen IX (1058) and Gregory VII (1074) visited. In 1093, Emperor Henry IV besieged the Rocca dei Papi, and Emperor Frederick Barbarossa’s visit in 1185 confirmed its strategic importance. By the 13th century, under Pope Innocent III, the fortress was fortified, serving as a summer residence for popes <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>. In 1369, Pope Urban V granted Montefiascone city status and a diocese, cementing its ecclesiastical role <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The legend of Est! Est!! Est!!! wine emerged in 1111, when German prelate Johannes Defuk, traveling to Rome, was so enamored with Montefiascone’s wine that his servant marked “Est! Est!! Est!!!” on a local inn’s door. Defuk reportedly drank himself to death, leaving his wealth to the town with instructions to pour a barrel of wine on his tomb annually, a tradition now symbolically reenacted <sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. The Renaissance saw the cathedral’s dome construction, completed after centuries of delays, while the 17th century brought decline until Cardinal Marco Antonio Barbarigo restored the town’s splendor <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Montefiascone joined the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, with a near-unanimous vote (1,469 for, 4 against). The 20th century saw modernization, including sewers and the Cimino aqueduct, but Allied bombings in 1944 caused minor damage. Today, Montefiascone’s preserved medieval core and ongoing restoration efforts, such as the Rocca dei Papi, highlight its historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
