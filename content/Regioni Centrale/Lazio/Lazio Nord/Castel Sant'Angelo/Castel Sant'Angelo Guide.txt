<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Castel Sant’Angelo’s history spans over 2,000 years, rooted in its strategic position along the Via Salaria in the Velino Valley. Likely settled by the Sabines around the 6th century BC, the area was a trade outpost, with archaeological finds like pottery and tools evidencing early habitation <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup>). Under Roman rule from the 3rd century BC, Castel Sant’Angelo (named after the Archangel Michael, protector of fortified sites) thrived as a stop along the Via Salaria, connecting Rome to the Adriatic Sea.</p>

    <p>By the Middle Ages, the hamlet was a feudal settlement under the Duchy of Spoleto, with the Chiesa di San Michele Arcangelo built in the 16th century as a religious center <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 13th century saw the construction of small fortifications, now lost, to protect against invasions. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes adorning chapels like Santa Maria. The 19th century saw Castel Sant’Angelo join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture, particularly chestnuts and olives <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration due to economic decline. The 2016 and 2017 Central Italy earthquakes caused minor damage to structures like the Chiesa di San Michele Arcangelo, with repairs ongoing. Reconstruction efforts, supported by regional aid, focus on preserving the hamlet’s heritage <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Post-earthquake tourism initiatives, such as the Sagra della Castagna e del Fungo Porcino, aim to revitalize the economy. Recent archaeological digs along the Via Salaria near Castel Sant’Angelo have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico di Antrodoco, reinforcing the hamlet’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Sabine settlement to resilient hamlet, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Castel Sant’Angelo’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a rural stop along the Via Salaria. The Roman period left traces like milestones along the SS 4, while the medieval period saw the hamlet under noble families like the Colonna. The Spanish period (16th–18th centuries) introduced minor defensive structures, while the Risorgimento saw Castel Sant’Angelo as a minor hub for unification efforts. The hamlet’s resilience through earthquakes and its preservation of rural heritage make it a living testament to Lazio’s layered history.</p>
