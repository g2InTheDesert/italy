<p>Castel Sant’Angelo, a lakeside village on Lake Bracciano in Lazio, is named for its 16th-century Orsini-Odescalchi Castle, a Renaissance fortress hosting weddings and events. Its volcanic lake offers swimming and sailing, while the medieval hamlet’s trattorias serve lake fish and porchetta. A quiet retreat from Rome, Castel Sant’Angelo’s scenic beauty, historic charm, and proximity to Bracciano’s aristocratic past make it a serene destination for day-trippers and nature lovers.</p>
