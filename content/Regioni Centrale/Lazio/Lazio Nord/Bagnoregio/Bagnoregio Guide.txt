    <h2 class="guide-section-header">Culture</h2>
    
    <p>Bagnoregio’s cultural landscape is a captivating blend of medieval architecture, religious traditions, and vibrant festivals, with Civita di Bagnoregio as its crown jewel. Civita, a pedestrian-only hamlet accessible via a 300-meter footbridge, is renowned for its preserved medieval character and dramatic position atop a tuff hill. The <strong>San Donato Church</strong> in Civita’s Piazza San Donato is a cultural highlight, a Romanesque structure renovated in the 16th century, housing a 15th-century wooden crucifix by the school of Donatello and a fresco by the school of Perugino. The church is the focal point of Civita’s cultural life, hosting religious ceremonies and concerts during festivals <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-15">15</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Geological and Landslides Museum</strong> in Civita’s Palazzo Alemanni, a Renaissance palace from 1585, offers insights into the region’s geological challenges, displaying exhibits on the tuff erosion that threatens Civita’s survival. Entry costs €3, with guided tours available for €5, providing a unique blend of science and culture <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The <strong>Antica Civitas</strong>, a network of Etruscan caves beneath Civita, and the <strong>Cappella della Madonna del Carcere</strong>, a small chapel with medieval frescoes, add to the hamlet’s cultural allure, offering visitors a glimpse into its ancient roots <sup><a href="#cite-16">16</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In Bagnoregio’s main town, the <strong>Cattedrale di San Nicola e San Donato</strong> in Piazza Cavour is a cultural cornerstone. Built in the 15th century and assuming cathedral status in the 17th century after Civita’s church was abandoned due to erosion, it features frescoes by Taddeo di Bartolo and a simple, elegant facade <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. The <strong>Chiesa di Sant’Agostino</strong>, with its 14th-century Gothic architecture and frescoes by Giovanni di Paolo, is another gem, hosting art exhibitions and religious events <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Bagnoregio’s cultural calendar is vibrant, with events that celebrate its heritage. The <strong>Palio della Tonna</strong>, held the first Sunday of June and second Sunday of September, is a historic donkey race in Civita’s main square, accompanied by medieval reenactments and flag-waving performances <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. The <strong>Civit’Arte</strong> festival in July and August features music, theater, and art exhibitions in Civita’s historic settings, drawing international artists <sup><a href="#cite-16">16</a></sup>. The <strong>Festa della Castagna</strong> in October celebrates chestnuts with food stalls and music, while the <strong>Presepe Vivente</strong> (Living Nativity) on December 26, January 1, and January 6 transforms Civita into a living Christmas scene with 50 actors in traditional costumes <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. These events, combined with Bagnoregio’s architectural treasures, create a rich cultural experience that bridges past and present.</p>

<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Bagnoregio’s history is a layered narrative of Etruscan origins, Roman prosperity, and medieval resilience, shaped by its strategic position in the Valle dei Calanchi. Founded by the Etruscans over 2,500 years ago, Bagnoregio (then Bagnorea, possibly from *Balneum Regis* or “King’s Bath” due to nearby thermal springs) was a thriving settlement. The Etruscans built Civita’s acropolis, with a temple and forum, and engineered drainage channels to combat seismic instability, recognizing the area’s vulnerability to erosion <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. The nearby Via Cassia and Tiber River facilitated trade, connecting Bagnoregio to Rome and other Etruscan cities <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Bagnoregio became a fortified town, with aqueducts and villas supporting its agricultural and fishing economy. After the Roman Empire’s fall, it was conquered by Goths, then Lombards, and gifted to the Papal States by Charlemagne in the 8th century. The Middle Ages saw Bagnoregio flourish as an independent commune, with Civita as its political and religious center. However, a devastating earthquake in 1695 triggered a mass exodus from Civita, accelerating its decline and earning it the nickname “The Dying City” <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 16th century brought Bagnoregio under the control of Orvieto and later the Monaldeschi family, until local forces destroyed their castle in 1494, securing independence. In 1496, Pope Alexander VI imposed cardinal rule, lasting until 1612 <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>. Civita’s isolation grew as erosion destroyed the saddle connecting it to Bagnoregio, with the modern pedestrian bridge built in 1965 <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Bagnoregio join unified Italy, while Civita’s population dwindled to just 11 residents by 2021 <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Recent efforts to preserve Civita, including a €5 entry fee introduced in 2013, have funded restoration projects, with support from figures like Ennio Morricone and Bernardo Bertolucci advocating for UNESCO status <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. Bagnoregio’s history, from Etruscan ingenuity to modern conservation, is a testament to its enduring cultural significance.</p>

    <p>Cultural events shape daily life, with the Palio della Tonna and Civit’Arte festival drawing crowds to Civita, while Bagnoregio hosts concerts and markets.

Bagnoregio’s expat community, drawn by its affordability, adds diversity, with English-language tours available <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
