<p>Bagnoregio, Lazio’s “Dying City,” is a hauntingly beautiful hilltop village, nearly abandoned yet mesmerizing. Accessible only by a pedestrian bridge, its medieval stone houses and Chiesa di San Donato evoke a ghost town frozen in time. Surrounded by the surreal Valle dei Calanchi, Bagnoregio’s ethereal charm draws artists and photographers. Local wines and rustic dishes like fregnacce pasta add flavor. A UNESCO candidate, Bagnoregio’s fragile beauty and otherworldly ambiance make it a unique Lazio destination.</p>
