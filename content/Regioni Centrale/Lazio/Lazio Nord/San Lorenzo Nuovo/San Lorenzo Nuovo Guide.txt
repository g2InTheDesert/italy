The <strong>Piazza Europa</strong>, the town’s central square, is the heart of its cultural life, designed as the focal point of the octagonal grid by 18th-century architect Francesco Navone. The square is surrounded by elegant buildings, including the <strong>Chiesa di San Lorenzo Martire</strong>, a Baroque church completed in 1775.

<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>San Lorenzo Nuovo’s history is a fascinating blend of Etruscan origins, medieval resilience, and 18th-century urban innovation, shaped by its strategic position near Lake Bolsena. The area was inhabited by the Etruscans by the 6th century BC, with archaeological finds, including pottery and tombs near the lake, evidencing their presence. The Etruscans used the hilltop for defensive settlements, leveraging the region’s volcanic tuff for construction <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. Under Roman rule, the area, part of the Via Cassia network, supported agriculture and trade, with villas and aqueducts built along the lake <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The original medieval village, San Lorenzo Vecchio, was located closer to Lake Bolsena but suffered from malaria outbreaks due to marshy conditions. In 1747, under Pope Benedict XIV, the decision was made to relocate the population to a healthier hilltop site. Architect Francesco Navone designed the new town, San Lorenzo Nuovo, with an octagonal grid layout, a pioneering urban plan inspired by Enlightenment ideals of symmetry and functionality. Completed in 1775, the town featured the Chiesa di San Lorenzo and Palazzo Comunale, with streets radiating from Piazza Europa <sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>During the Middle Ages, San Lorenzo Vecchio was under papal control, serving as a minor outpost in the Tuscia region. The 13th-century <strong>Chiesa di San Rocco</strong>, now in ruins near the old village, was a key religious site until the relocation. The Papal States invested in the new town’s infrastructure, including aqueducts and roads, to ensure its success <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. The 19th century saw San Lorenzo Nuovo join unified Italy in 1870, with minimal disruption due to its small size.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought modernization, with the town’s railway station in Orte (25 km away) facilitating trade. World War II spared San Lorenzo Nuovo significant damage, preserving its 18th-century core. Recent efforts to highlight its unique urban design have boosted tourism, with the Palazzo Comunale museum showcasing Navone’s plans <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. San Lorenzo Nuovo’s history, from Etruscan settlements to Enlightenment-era innovation, underscores its enduring appeal as a cultural and historical destination.</p>
