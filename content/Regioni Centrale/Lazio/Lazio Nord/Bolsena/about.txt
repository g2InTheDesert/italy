<p>Bolsena, a picturesque town on Lake Bolsena’s shores in Lazio, is steeped in history and spirituality. Its medieval Castello Monaldeschi houses a museum, while the Basilica di Santa Cristina commemorates a 4th-century miracle. The lake, Europe’s largest volcanic crater, offers beaches and fishing, with local eateries serving coregone and Sbroscia soup. Bolsena’s summer festivals and proximity to Civita di Bagnoregio make it a vibrant base for exploring northern Lazio’s natural and cultural riches.</p>
