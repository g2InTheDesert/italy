<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Bolsena’s history is a rich narrative of Etruscan origins, Roman prosperity, and medieval sanctity, shaped by its strategic lakeside location. Founded as the Etruscan city of Velzna (or Volsinii) around the 6th century BC, Bolsena was a major center of the Etruscan League, known for its temple to Voltumna, the goddess of the Etruscans. Archaeological finds, including tombs and bronze artifacts near the lake, evidence its early wealth and trade connections <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. In 264 BC, the Romans destroyed Velzna, relocating its inhabitants to the current site, renamed Volsinii Novi, and built villas, roads, and aqueducts along the Via Cassia <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>After the Roman Empire’s fall, Bolsena was invaded by Goths and Lombards, but its position made it a defensible outpost. By the 8th century, it was under papal control, with the Basilica di Santa Cristina becoming a religious hub. The Miracle of Bolsena in 1263, when a host bled during Mass, led to the establishment of the Corpus Domini feast and influenced the construction of Orvieto’s cathedral. This event elevated Bolsena’s spiritual significance, drawing pilgrims and popes <sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw the Monaldeschi family fortify the Rocca in the 13th century, protecting Bolsena during conflicts between papal states and neighboring powers. The fortress was a papal residence, hosting figures like Pope Boniface VIII <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. In the 16th century, the Farnese family added Renaissance elements to the town, including frescoes in San Francesco. Bolsena joined unified Italy in 1870, with minimal disruption due to its small size <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought modernization, with the lake’s fishing industry thriving. World War II spared Bolsena significant damage, preserving its medieval core. Recent restoration efforts, including the Rocca Monaldeschi and Santa Cristina’s catacombs, have boosted tourism, with initiatives for UNESCO recognition for the town’s historical and religious significance <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Bolsena’s history, from Etruscan Velzna to a sacred pilgrimage site, underscores its enduring appeal.</p>
