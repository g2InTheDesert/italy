<p>Rome, the Eternal City, is a living museum where ancient, Renaissance, and baroque treasures coexist with vibrant modern life. The Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Pantheon evoke its imperial past, while St. Peter’s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel anchor its spiritual heart. Piazza Navona and the Spanish Steps buzz with energy, and trattorias serve carbonara and cacio e pepe. Rome’s layers—Etruscan, Roman, papal, and contemporary—make it an inexhaustible destination for history, art, romance, and culinary delights.</p>
