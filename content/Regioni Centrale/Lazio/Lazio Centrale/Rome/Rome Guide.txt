<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Rome’s history spans over 3,000 years, from a small Latin village to the capital of a vast empire and modern Italy. According to legend, founded in 753 BC by Romulus, Rome’s early history is tied to Etruscan influences, evident in artifacts from the Capitoline Museums. By the 6th century BC, it was a monarchy, transitioning to a republic in 509 BC. The Roman Republic expanded through conquests, building iconic structures like the Roman Forum and early aqueducts <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Roman Empire, established in 27 BC under Augustus, saw Rome’s peak, with engineering marvels like the Colosseum (70–80 AD) and aqueducts supplying water to a city of 1 million. Christianity’s rise transformed Rome, with Constantine’s Edict of Milan (313 AD) legalizing the faith, leading to basilicas like Santa Maria Maggiore. The empire’s fall in 476 AD marked the Middle Ages, with Rome under papal control, fostering medieval art and architecture <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance (14th–17th centuries) revitalized Rome, with popes like Julius II commissioning works by Michelangelo and Raphael. The Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica reflect this era’s splendor. The 17th-century Baroque period added fountains like the Trevi Fountain, designed by Nicola Salvi. Rome became Italy’s capital in 1871 after unification, modernizing with new districts like EUR, built under Mussolini <sup><a href="#cite-21">21</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>World War II spared Rome major destruction, and post-war growth solidified its role as a cultural and political hub. Today, Rome’s historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1980, preserves its layered past, from Roman roads to Renaissance palaces, drawing scholars and tourists alike <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

Tourism is a major driver, with 15 million visitors annually contributing €10 billion to the economy. The city also thrives in film, fashion, and government, hosting institutions like the Italian Parliament and Cinecittà Studios, where films like *Ben-Hur* were shot <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Testaccio</strong> and <strong>Trastevere</strong> neighborhoods are hubs of contemporary life, with lively markets, street art, and nightlife. Piazza Navona and Campo de’ Fiori buzz with cafes and performers, while <strong>EUR</strong> showcases modernist architecture, including the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. Rome’s universities, like La Sapienza (founded 1303), attract 100,000 students, fostering a vibrant youth culture in areas like San Lorenzo <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Events shape daily life, from the <strong>Rome Marathon</strong> (March) to <strong>Natale di Roma</strong> (April 21), celebrating the city’s founding with parades. Sustainability initiatives, like bike-sharing and pedestrian zones, address urban challenges, while cultural diversity from immigrant communities adds global flavors to Rome’s social fabric <sup><a href="#cite-22">22</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Rome’s tech sector grows, with startups in Prati and Ostiense, and its fashion scene shines with brands like Fendi. The city’s 2025 calendar includes the <strong>Jubilee Year</strong>, expecting 30 million pilgrims for events centered on St. Peter’s, boosting local businesses <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>.
