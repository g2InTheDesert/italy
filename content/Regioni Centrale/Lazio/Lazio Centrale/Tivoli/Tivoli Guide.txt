    <h2 class="guide-section-header">Culture</h2>
    
    <p>Tivoli’s cultural landscape is a vibrant tapestry woven from its ancient Roman roots, Renaissance splendor, and modern festivals. The town’s most iconic cultural sites are <strong>Villa Adriana</strong> (Hadrian’s Villa) and <strong>Villa d’Este</strong>, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites, though this section focuses on Tivoli’s broader cultural offerings, with Villa d’Este covered separately as requested. Villa Adriana, built in the 2nd century AD by Emperor Hadrian, is a sprawling archaeological complex featuring palaces, temples, and gardens inspired by Greek and Egyptian architecture. Its Canopus pool and Serapeum reflect Hadrian’s cosmopolitan vision, drawing thousands of visitors annually. Tickets cost €12, with guided tours available for €20 <sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Beyond these landmarks, Tivoli’s historic center is a cultural gem, with medieval streets and churches like the <strong>Cathedral of San Lorenzo</strong>. This 17th-century cathedral houses a venerated wooden sculpture, the *Deposition of Christ*, and a silver statue of San Lorenzo, displayed during the August festival in his honor. The <strong>Church of Santa Maria Maggiore</strong>, near Villa d’Este, features Gothic elements and frescoes, adding to Tivoli’s religious and artistic heritage <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Tivoli’s cultural calendar is lively, with events that celebrate its history and community spirit.

The <strong>Tivoli Folk Festival</strong>, held in summer, showcases Lazio’s folk music and dance, attracting locals and tourists to the town’s squares. The <strong>Sagra del Pizzutello</strong>, a September festival, celebrates Tivoli’s sweet, elongated grape variety with tastings, markets, and cultural performances <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Rocca Pia</strong>, a 15th-century fortress built by Pope Pius II, is another cultural landmark, now hosting art exhibitions and concerts. Its imposing towers and strategic location offer insights into Tivoli’s medieval defenses. The <strong>Anfiteatro di Bleso</strong>, a Roman amphitheater, and the <strong>Sanctuary of Hercules Victor</strong>, a 2nd-century BC temple, provide archaeological depth, with guided tours revealing their significance <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Tivoli’s position on the Aniene River enhances its cultural appeal, with the <strong>Villa Gregoriana</strong>, a park managed by FAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano), offering dramatic waterfalls and grottoes. Created in 1835 after a flood, it features trails through lush greenery and the Great Waterfall, a testament to Tivoli’s integration of nature and culture.

<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Tivoli’s history spans over three millennia, beginning as the ancient Latin settlement of Tibur in the 13th century BC. Its strategic location on trade routes and proximity to the Aniene River made it a prosperous center. By the 4th century BC, Tibur was a rival to Rome, but it allied with the Romans in 338 BC, becoming a key colony. The town’s wealth attracted Roman elites, who built lavish villas, including Hadrian’s Villa, constructed between 118 and 138 AD as a retreat for Emperor Hadrian. This complex, covering 120 hectares, included libraries, baths, and theaters, reflecting Rome’s imperial grandeur <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In the Republican era, Tivoli was a hub for temples like the Sanctuary of Hercules Victor, dedicated to the patron deity of commerce. The Roman period saw engineering feats, such as aqueducts channeling Aniene water to Rome, remnants of which are visible today. After the Roman Empire’s fall, Tivoli faced invasions by Goths and Byzantines, but its medieval period brought renewed significance under the Holy Roman Empire. The town’s fortifications, including Rocca Pia, were built to counter regional conflicts <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance transformed Tivoli into a cultural center, with Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este commissioning Villa d’Este in 1550, a masterpiece of garden design. The town’s prosperity continued under papal rule, with artists like Bernini contributing to its architecture. The 19th century saw industrial growth, with paper mills along the Aniene, and Tivoli joined unified Italy in 1870. World War II brought damage, but post-war restoration preserved its historic core, earning UNESCO status for Villa Adriana (1999) and Villa d’Este (2001) <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Tivoli’s history is also tied to its role as a summer retreat for Romans, a tradition that persists today. Archaeological excavations continue to uncover artifacts, enriching the town’s historical narrative and making it a living museum of Latin, Roman, and Renaissance heritage.</p>
