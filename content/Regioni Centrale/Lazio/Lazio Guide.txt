<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Lazio’s history is a saga of ancient empires, papal power, and cultural innovation, beginning with Latin settlements around 1000 BC. The Latins established Rome in 753 BC, which grew from a kingdom to a republic in 509 BC, conquering the Mediterranean by the 1st century BC.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) centered in Rome, with innovations in law, engineering, and architecture like the Colosseum and aqueducts near Tivoli.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>The empire’s fall in 476 AD led to Ostrogoth and Byzantine rule, with Rome becoming a papal center by the 8th century.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The Middle Ages saw the rise of the Papal States, with Viterbo as a papal residence in the 13th century, hosting conclaves at the Palazzo dei Papi.<sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup> The Renaissance (14th–17th centuries) flourished under popes like Julius II, with Michelangelo and Raphael creating masterpieces in the Vatican and Villa d’Este in Tivoli.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>The Grand Tour in the 18th century brought European travelers to Rome, boosting cultural exchange. The Risorgimento led to unification in 1870, with Rome becoming Italy’s capital after the capture of the city.<sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup> The 20th century brought fascism under Mussolini, with Rome as the capital, and World War II bombings damaged historic sites. Post-war economic boom transformed Lazio, with tourism becoming a major industry after UNESCO designations for Rome’s historic center (1980) and Tarquinia’s necropolis (2004) <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>. The 2000 Jubilee drew millions to the Vatican. The 1971 earthquake affected Bagnoregio, accelerating its depopulation, while the 2016 earthquake spared most of Lazio but impacted nearby Umbria <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. Today, Lazio balances its ancient legacy with modern development, from UNESCO sites to sustainable tourism.</p>

    <p>Lazio’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as the cradle of Western civilization. The Etruscans introduced advanced metallurgy in Tarquinia, while Romans built aqueducts in Nepi.<sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup> The medieval period saw the Vatican as a power center, influencing Europe. The Renaissance fostered humanism, with the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo. The 18th-century papal rule brought archaeological excavations in Tivoli. The 19th-century unification made Rome the symbol of Italian unity. The 20th century saw Lazio’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans in the Castelli Romani near Tivoli. The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Rome, while rural areas like Bolsena focused on agriculture. Recent preservation efforts, like the Lake Bolsena environmental projects, highlight ecological history <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. Lazio’s history, marked by imperial glory and spiritual depth, continues to define its identity.</p>

    <p>The region’s historical significance extends to its role in religion, with the Vatican as the Catholic Church’s seat since the 1st century. The 1870 capture of Rome ended papal temporal power. Lazio’s history, blending Etruscan innovation and Roman grandeur, offers a living testament to its layered past.</p>
