<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Abruzzo’s history is a saga of ancient tribes, medieval resilience, and rural traditions, beginning with Samnite settlements around 600 BC. The Samnites, an Italic tribe, established hilltop towns like Chieti, resisting Roman expansion until the 1st century BC.<sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup> Rome conquered Abruzzo, transforming it with roads like the Via Tiburtina and villas along the Adriatic coast.<sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup></p>

    <p>The fall of Rome in 476 AD led to Lombard rule, who fortified villages like L’Aquila.<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup> The Middle Ages saw the rise of feudal estates, with Sulmona emerging as a trade hub. The Norman conquest in the 11th century brought castles like Rocca Calascio. The 13th century saw the founding of L’Aquila by Frederick II, uniting 99 villages.<sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup> The Spanish Aragon dynasty ruled in the 15th century, leaving architectural influences in Atri.</p>

    <p>The Bourbon era (18th–19th centuries) brought agricultural reforms, improving yields in Pescara. The Risorgimento led to unification in 1860, with Abruzzo joining the Kingdom of Italy after local uprisings.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century brought industrialization in Pescara, but rural areas like Scanno remained pastoral. The 2009 L’Aquila earthquake (6.3 magnitude) killed over 300, prompting ongoing reconstruction <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Post-war economic boom transformed Abruzzo, with tourism thriving after UNESCO designation for the Perdonanza Celestiniana in 2019 <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. Today, Abruzzo balances its ancient legacy with modern development, from national parks to coastal resorts.</p>

    <p>Abruzzo’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a pastoral crossroads. The Samnites introduced transhumance, moving livestock along tratturi trails.<sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup> Romans built amphitheaters in Teramo. The medieval period saw monastic orders in the Maiella Mountains, influencing spirituality. The Renaissance brought art to Sulmona’s churches. The 18th-century Bourbon rule improved irrigation in the Sangro Valley. The 19th-century unification introduced railways like Pescara-L’Aquila.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century saw Abruzzo’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans in the Gran Sasso. The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Pescara, while rural areas focused on wine. Recent preservation efforts, like the Gran Sasso National Park, highlight ecological history <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. Abruzzo’s history, marked by pastoral resilience and cultural depth, continues to define its identity.</p>

    <p>The region’s historical significance extends to its role in transhumance, a UNESCO intangible heritage. The 2009 earthquake spurred global support for L’Aquila’s restoration. Abruzzo’s history, blending ancient tribes and modern recovery, offers a living testament to its layered past.</p>
