<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Martinsicuro’s history spans over 2,000 years, rooted in its strategic position along the Adriatic Coast. Likely settled by the Piceni around the 5th century BC, Martinsicuro (named after the Roman *Castrum Martis*) was a coastal outpost, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs evidencing early habitation <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Under Roman rule from the 3rd century BC, it thrived along the Via Salaria, with a port facilitating trade with the Balkans.</p>

    <p>By the Middle Ages, Martinsicuro was a fishing village under the Duchy of Spoleto. The 16th century saw Spanish rule, with the Torre di Carlo V built to defend against Ottoman pirates <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with the Chiesa di San Gabriele constructed in the 19th century as a religious center <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Martinsicuro join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on fishing and agriculture.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with World War II bombings damaging the port, followed by reconstruction. The 1960s tourism boom transformed Martinsicuro into a seaside resort, with the development of the Lungomare Italia. The 2009 L’Aquila earthquake caused minor damage, repaired by 2010. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Sagra del Pesce and regional promotion of Abruzzo’s coastline, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Torre di Carlo V have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo delle Armi Antiche, reinforcing Martinsicuro’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Piceni settlement to coastal resort, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Martinsicuro’s historical narrative is enriched by its maritime and agricultural legacy. The Roman period left traces like the Castrum Martis, a fortified settlement. The Spanish period introduced defensive structures, while the 19th-century Risorgimento saw Martinsicuro as a minor hub for unification efforts. The 20th-century tourism boom brought modern infrastructure, with hotels and restaurants catering to visitors. Martinsicuro’s preservation of its watchtower and coastal heritage makes it a living testament to Abruzzo’s layered history.</p>
