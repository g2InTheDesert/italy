<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>

    <p>Italy’s history is a saga of empires, city-states, and unification, shaping Western civilization. Ancient Italy was inhabited by Italics, Etruscans, and Greeks, with Rome founded in 753 BC as a kingdom, becoming a republic in 509 BC. The Roman Republic expanded, conquering the Mediterranean by the 1st century BC, evolving into an empire under Augustus in 27 BC. At its peak, the Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) spanned Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, with innovations in law, engineering, and architecture like aqueducts and roads <sup><a href="#cite-26">26</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-27">27</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The empire’s fall in 476 AD led to the Middle Ages, with Italy fragmented into city-states and kingdoms. The Byzantine Empire controlled the south, while the Lombards and Franks dominated the north. The 11th century saw the rise of maritime republics like Venice, Genoa, and Amalfi, facilitating trade with the East. The Renaissance (14th–17th centuries) began in Tuscany, with figures like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo revolutionizing art, science, and thought. City-states like Florence and Venice flourished, sponsoring artistic patronage <sup><a href="#cite-28">28</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-29">29</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 16th century brought foreign domination, with Spain, Austria, and France controlling parts of Italy. The Risorgimento (19th century) led to unification, with Giuseppe Garibaldi’s Expedition of the Thousand in 1860 and the capture of Rome in 1870 establishing the Kingdom of Italy. World War I (1915–1918) cost Italy dearly, leading to fascism under Benito Mussolini in 1922. World War II (1940–1945) saw Italy ally with Nazi Germany, ending with Allied liberation and the republic’s birth in 1946 <sup><a href="#cite-26">26</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-30">30</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Post-war Italy experienced the “economic miracle,” transforming from agrarian to industrial power. The 1970s “Years of Lead” saw terrorism, while the 1990s Mani Pulite scandals reformed politics. Today, Italy is a democratic republic with a parliamentary system, facing challenges like economic stagnation and immigration. Its history, from Roman glory to modern democracy, underscores its enduring impact on the world.</p>

    <p>Italy’s history is marked by regional disparities. The north developed city-states like Milan, while the south was under Norman and Spanish rule. The Vatican’s influence, as the seat of the Catholic Church, shaped politics, with popes like Innocent III wielding power. The Enlightenment brought reforms under Austrian rule in the north. The unification movement, driven by Cavour and Mazzini, overcame obstacles like Austrian occupation. Fascism’s rise led to colonial adventures in Africa and alliance with Hitler, culminating in civil war. The post-war era saw the Christian Democrats dominate, with economic boom in the 1950s–60s. The 21st century has seen political instability, with figures like Berlusconi and Renzi. Italy’s history is a mosaic of triumph and tragedy.</p>
