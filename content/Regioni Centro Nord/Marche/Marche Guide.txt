    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Marche’s history is a saga of ancient tribes, Renaissance splendor, and rural resilience, beginning with Picene settlements around 900 BC. The Picenes, an Italic tribe, established coastal towns like Ancona, trading with Greeks and Etruscans.<sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup> Rome conquered Marche by the 3rd century BC, transforming it with roads like the Via Flaminia and amphitheaters in Fano.<sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup></p>

    <p>The fall of Rome in 476 AD led to Byzantine rule, with Ancona as a key port. The Middle Ages saw the rise of communes, with Urbino under the Montefeltro family becoming a Renaissance hub in the 15th century, fostering artists like Raphael.<sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup> The Papal States controlled Marche until the 19th century, with reforms improving agriculture in Ascoli Piceno. The Risorgimento led to unification in 1860, with Marche joining the Kingdom of Italy after local uprisings.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>The 20th century brought industrialization in Ancona, but rural areas like Macerata remained agricultural. The 2016 earthquake (6.2 magnitude) damaged towns like Arquata del Tronto, prompting ongoing reconstruction <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.

The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Pesaro, while rural areas focused on wine. Recent preservation efforts, like the Sibillini National Park, highlight ecological history <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>.
