<p>Toscana Garfagnana, a rugged pocket of northern Tuscany, is defined by its lush Apennine landscapes and historic villages. Barga, with its medieval streets and stunning cathedral, exudes charm, while Castiglione di Garfagnana boasts fortified walls. The iconic Ponte della Maddalena, a medieval “Devil’s Bridge,” spans the Serchio River, and San Pellegrino in Alpe offers alpine views. Towns like Bagni di Lucca, known for thermal springs, and Montefegatesi’s remote serenity make Garfagnana a paradise for hikers, history buffs, and nature lovers.</p>
