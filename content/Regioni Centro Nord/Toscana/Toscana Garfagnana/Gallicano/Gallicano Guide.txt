<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Gallicano’s history spans over a millennium, rooted in its strategic position in the Serchio Valley. Likely founded by the Ligurians around the 5th century BC, Gallicano was later settled by the Etruscans, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the village evidencing their presence by the 6th century BC. The name Gallicano may derive from the Latin *Gallicanum*, possibly linked to a Roman landowner or settlement <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 8th century, Gallicano was a Lombard settlement, with the Chiesa di San Jacopo established as a parish under the Diocese of Lucca. In the 12th century, the town aligned with the Republic of Lucca, fortifying its defenses during conflicts with Pisa and Florence. The <strong>Battle of Altopascio</strong> (1325), fought 15 kilometers away, underscored the region’s strategic importance, with Gallicano contributing resources to Lucca’s efforts <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 14th century, the town passed to the Este family of Ferrara, who maintained its agricultural economy, centered on chestnuts, spelt, and olives.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought prosperity, with Gallicano supplying wool and timber to Lucca’s markets. The Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista in Verni was built in the 16th century, reflecting the town’s growth <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The 19th century saw economic challenges, with emigration to Scotland and the Americas, though less pronounced than in Barga. By 1861, Gallicano joined unified Italy, with its population peaking at around 3,000 <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought the 1920 Garfagnana earthquake, which damaged San Jacopo’s bell tower, repaired by 1935. World War II saw Gallicano as a minor resistance hub, with partisans active in the Apennines. Post-war depopulation reduced the population, but recent tourism initiatives, including festival promotion and trail development, have revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recognized as part of Garfagnana’s “Borghi più belli d’Italia” network, Gallicano’s history, from Etruscan roots to modern revival, underscores its enduring appeal.</p>
