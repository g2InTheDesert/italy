    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Bagni di Lucca’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its thermal springs and strategic Serchio Valley location. The Etruscans, by the 6th century BC, used the area’s hot springs for rituals, with archaeological finds like pottery and votive offerings near the baths evidencing their presence <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Under Roman rule, known as *Balnea Lucensia*, the springs attracted elites, with aqueducts and villas built along the Serchio River. The Via Cassia facilitated trade, connecting Bagni di Lucca to Lucca and Rome <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 8th century, the Lombards fortified the area, with the Chiesa di San Martino established as a parish. In the 12th century, Bagni di Lucca became a fief of the Republic of Lucca, thriving as a spa and trade hub. The <strong>Battle of Altopascio</strong> (1325) underscored its strategic role, with Lucca defending the valley against Florence <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 14th century, the Este family of Ferrara controlled the town, enhancing its thermal facilities and fortifying villages like Montefegatesi.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance saw Bagni di Lucca flourish as a spa destination, with the Teatro Accademico built in 1689 for cultural entertainment. The 19th century marked its golden age, when European nobility, including Lord Byron, Shelley, and Napoleon’s sister Elisa Baciocchi, frequented the baths. The Jean Varraud Baths, constructed in 1828, reflected neoclassical elegance <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. By 1861, Bagni di Lucca joined unified Italy, with its thermal industry peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with the 1920 Garfagnana earthquake damaging churches and baths, repaired by 1935. World War II saw partisan activity in the Apennines, with Bagni di Lucca serving as a resistance base. Post-war tourism revived the baths, and restoration efforts preserved the medieval core, earning Bagni di Lucca the “Bandiera Arancione” for tourism excellence <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the springs have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in local museums, reinforcing the town’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.
