<p>Barga, a picturesque hilltop town in Tuscany’s Garfagnana, is a medieval gem with Scottish ties due to its emigrant community. Its Duomo di San Cristoforo, a Romanesque masterpiece, offers Serchio Valley views, while narrow alleys brim with artisan shops. Barga’s jazz festival and vibrant cultural scene draw artists, and its cuisine, featuring trout and chestnut polenta, celebrates local bounty. Surrounded by the Apuan Alps, Barga’s blend of history, music, and mountain charm makes it a unique Tuscan retreat.</p>
