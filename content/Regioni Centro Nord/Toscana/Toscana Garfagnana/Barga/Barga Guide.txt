<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Barga’s history spans over a millennium, rooted in its strategic position in the Serchio Valley. Likely founded by the Ligurians around the 5th century BC, Barga was later settled by the Etruscans, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the village evidencing their presence by the 6th century BC. The name Barga may derive from the Etruscan *barg*, meaning “hill” <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 9th century, Barga was a Lombard stronghold, with the Duomo di San Cristoforo built as a religious center. In the 12th century, it became a fief of the Rolandinghi family, aligning with the Republic of Lucca against Pisa and Florence. The <strong>Battle of Casciana</strong> (1313) saw Barga’s defenses hold firm, securing its loyalty to Lucca <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 14th century, Barga briefly fell to Florence but was reclaimed by Lucca under Castruccio Castracani, who fortified the town’s walls, parts of which still stand <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought prosperity, with Barga serving as a trade hub for wool, silk, and chestnuts. The Teatro dei Differenti, built in 1689, reflected the town’s cultural growth, hosting performances for the Este family, who controlled Barga from 1522. The 19th century saw significant emigration to Scotland, particularly Glasgow, creating a lasting Scottish-Italian diaspora. By 1861, Barga joined unified Italy, with economic challenges prompting further emigration <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought modernization, with the 1920 Garfagnana earthquake causing minor damage to the Duomo, repaired by 1930. World War II saw Barga as a resistance hub, with partisans active in the Apennines. Post-war restoration preserved the medieval core, earning Barga the “Bandiera Arancione” (Orange Flag) for tourism excellence <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the village have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Casa Pascoli, reinforcing Barga’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan roots to Scottish diaspora, underscores its enduring cultural significance.</p>
