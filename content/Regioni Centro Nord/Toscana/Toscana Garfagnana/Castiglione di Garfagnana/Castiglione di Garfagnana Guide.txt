<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Castiglione di Garfagnana’s history spans over a millennium, rooted in its strategic position in the Serchio Valley. Likely founded by the Lombards in the 8th century as a defensive outpost, Castiglione (from Latin *castellum*, meaning small fortress) was named for its fortified hilltop. Etruscan influences are evident in nearby archaeological sites, with pottery and tombs dating to the 6th century BC, though Castiglione itself emerged later <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 10th century, Castiglione was under the control of the noble Attoni family, who built the Rocca as a stronghold against invasions. In the 12th century, it became a key possession of the Republic of Lucca, fortifying its walls during conflicts with Pisa and Florence. The <strong>Battle of Altopascio</strong> (1325) saw Castiglione’s defenses tested, with Lucca retaining control <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 14th century, the village passed to the Este family of Ferrara, who enhanced the Rocca and Chiesa di San Michele, adding Renaissance elements <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance period brought prosperity, with Castiglione serving as a trade hub for wool, chestnuts, and timber. The 16th-century construction of the <strong>Ponte della Maddalena</strong>, a nearby medieval bridge, facilitated commerce along the Serchio River <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. In 1814, Castiglione was incorporated into the Duchy of Modena, and by 1861, it joined unified Italy. The 20th century saw challenges, including emigration due to economic hardship, but post-World War II restoration efforts preserved the medieval core <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>A 1920 earthquake damaged parts of the Rocca, prompting significant repairs. Recent initiatives have restored the fortress and churches, boosting tourism, with Castiglione recognized as one of Italy’s “Borghi più belli d’Italia” (Most Beautiful Villages) <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Excavations near the village have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Museo Etnografico, reinforcing Castiglione’s historical legacy. Its history, from Lombard stronghold to Tuscan gem, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
