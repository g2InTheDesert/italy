<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Ponte della Maddalena’s history is a captivating tale of medieval engineering, religious significance, and enduring legacy, rooted in its strategic position in the Serchio Valley. Constructed around 1080–1100, likely under the patronage of Countess Matilda of Tuscany, the bridge facilitated trade and pilgrimage along the Via Francigena, connecting Lucca to northern Italy. Its humpbacked design, with four asymmetrical arches, was engineered to withstand the Serchio River’s floods, showcasing advanced medieval craftsmanship. The largest arch, spanning 37 meters, reflects the ingenuity of its builders, possibly monks or local masons <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The bridge’s nickname, “Devil’s Bridge,” stems from a legend that a mason, unable to complete the structure, made a pact with the devil, who finished it overnight in exchange for the first soul to cross. The mason tricked the devil by sending a dog across first, a story immortalized in local folklore <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. In the 12th century, the bridge became a key link for pilgrims traveling to Rome, with the nearby Chiesa di San Jacopo serving as a spiritual stop <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>During the Middle Ages, the bridge was under the Republic of Lucca’s control, surviving regional conflicts like the <strong>Battle of Altopascio</strong> (1325), which underscored the valley’s strategic importance <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. The Renaissance saw maintenance by the Este family, who ruled Garfagnana, ensuring the bridge’s functionality. In the 19th century, Bagni di Lucca’s rise as a spa destination brought visitors to the bridge, with artists like John Ruskin sketching its arches <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century saw repairs after flooding in 1836 and the 1920 Garfagnana earthquake, which caused minor damage. World War II spared the bridge, unlike many Italian structures, due to its civilian status. Restoration in the 1980s reinforced its stonework, and it was pedestrianized to preserve its integrity <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recognized as part of Borgo a Mozzano’s cultural heritage, Ponte della Maddalena’s history, from medieval engineering to modern icon, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
