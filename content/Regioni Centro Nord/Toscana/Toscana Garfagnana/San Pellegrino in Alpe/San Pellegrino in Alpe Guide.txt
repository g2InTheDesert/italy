    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>San Pellegrino in Alpe’s history is a captivating narrative of sacred origins, medieval pilgrimage, and rural endurance, shaped by its high-altitude position in the Apennines. The village’s roots trace to the 7th century, when, according to legend, Saint Pellegrino, an Irish prince, and Saint Bianco, his companion, sought solitude as hermits in the mountains. Their sanctity attracted pilgrims, and by the 9th century, a small chapel was built to house their relics, marking the village’s emergence as a pilgrimage site <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In the 12th century, the Santuario di San Pellegrino e San Bianco was constructed under the patronage of the Diocese of Lucca, becoming a key stop on the Via Francigena and Via del Volto Santo. The Ospizio provided shelter for pilgrims crossing the Apennines, with records of travelers from Canterbury and Santiago de Compostela <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The village aligned with the Republic of Lucca, serving as a border outpost against Modena’s Este family. The <strong>Battle of Altopascio</strong> (1325), fought 25 kilometers away, underscored the region’s strategic importance, with San Pellegrino’s high vantage point used for signaling <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw San Pellegrino flourish as a pilgrimage hub, with the sanctuary attracting devotees seeking miracles. The 14th century brought fortifications to protect against banditry, with parts of the village’s stone walls still visible. The Renaissance period was quieter, with the village sustaining itself through chestnut farming and pastoralism. The 16th-century construction of the <strong>Ponte della Maddalena</strong>, 20 kilometers away, facilitated trade along the Serchio River, indirectly benefiting San Pellegrino <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 19th century saw economic challenges, with emigration to Scotland and the Americas, though less pronounced than in Barga. By 1861, San Pellegrino joined unified Italy, with its population peaking at around 300. The 1920 Garfagnana earthquake damaged the sanctuary’s bell tower, repaired by 1930. World War II saw the village as a minor resistance hideout, with partisans using Apennine trails. Post-war depopulation reduced the population to fewer than 50, but the 1980 opening of the Museo Etnografico revitalized interest, boosting tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. San Pellegrino’s history, from sacred hermitage to modern pilgrimage site, underscores its enduring spiritual and cultural significance.</p>
