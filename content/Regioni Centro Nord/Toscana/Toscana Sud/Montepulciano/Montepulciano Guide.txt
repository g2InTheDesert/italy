<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Montepulciano’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic hilltop position between the Val d’Orcia and Val di Chiana. Founded by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, possibly as a satellite of Chiusi, the town was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Valdichiana Lake evidencing early settlement. The name Montepulciano, possibly from *Mons Politicus* (noble hill), reflects its prominence <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 8th century, Montepulciano was a Lombard settlement, with early Christian churches like the Chiesa di Sant’Agostino established. In the 12th century, it became a free commune, aligning with Siena against Florence. The <strong>Battle of Montaperti</strong> (1260) saw Montepulciano support Siena’s Ghibellines, reinforcing its strategic role <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. The 14th century brought the construction of the Palazzo Comunale and fortified walls, protecting against regional conflicts.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance marked Montepulciano’s golden age, with noble families like the Contucci and Del Monte commissioning palaces by architects like Sangallo. The Chiesa di San Biagio, completed in 1545, exemplified Renaissance ideals <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. In 1511, Montepulciano allied with Florence’s Medici, ending Sienese dominance. The 16th century saw the rise of Vino Nobile, with early winemaking records by the Ricci family <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. By 1861, Montepulciano joined unified Italy, with its wine industry gaining prominence.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of sharecropping. World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting nearby rail lines. Post-war restoration preserved the medieval and Renaissance core, and the 1960s saw Vino Nobile gain DOC status, boosting tourism. The Val d’Orcia’s UNESCO designation in 2004 elevated Montepulciano’s profile <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near San Biagio have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico, reinforcing Montepulciano’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan settlement to wine capital, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
