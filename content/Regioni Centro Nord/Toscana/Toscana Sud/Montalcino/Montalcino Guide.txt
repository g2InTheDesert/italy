<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Montalcino’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic hilltop position in the Val d’Orcia. Founded by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Asso River evidencing early settlement. The name Montalcino, possibly from *Mons Ilcinus* (Mount of Holm Oaks), reflects its wooded landscape <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 9th century, Montalcino was a Lombard settlement, with the Abbazia di Sant’Antimo established as a Benedictine monastery. In the 12th century, it became a free commune under the Republic of Siena, fortifying its defenses with the Fortezza di Montalcino in 1361. The <strong>Battle of Montalcino</strong> (1553) saw the town resist Florence’s Medici, delaying Siena’s fall until 1559 <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. The 14th century marked Montalcino’s rise as a wine-producing center, with early records of Sangiovese cultivation.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought prosperity, with Montalcino’s sharecropping economy supporting Siena’s markets. The 16th-century Palazzo Pieri, a noble residence, reflected the town’s wealth <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. In 1559, Montalcino fell to the Medici, marking the end of Sienese independence. The 19th century saw the development of Brunello di Montalcino wine, pioneered by the Biondi-Santi family in the 1860s, cementing the town’s global reputation <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. By 1861, Montalcino joined unified Italy, with its wine industry peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of sharecropping. World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting nearby rail lines. Post-war restoration preserved the medieval core, and the 1960s saw Brunello gain international acclaim, boosting tourism. The Val d’Orcia’s UNESCO designation in 2004 further elevated Montalcino’s profile <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near Sant’Antimo have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico, reinforcing Montalcino’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan settlement to wine capital, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
