<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Buonconvento’s history spans over a millennium, rooted in its strategic position in the Val d’Orcia. Likely founded by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Ombrone River evidencing early settlement. The name Buonconvento, possibly from Latin *bonus conventus* (good meeting place), reflects its role as a market center <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 12th century, Buonconvento was a fortified village under the Republic of Siena, with its medieval walls and gates, like the <strong>Porta Senese</strong>, built to protect against Florence. In 1313, Emperor Henry VII died in Buonconvento, reportedly poisoned, a pivotal event that strengthened Siena’s control <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. The 14th century saw the town flourish as a stop on the Via Francigena, with the Chiesa dei Santi Pietro e Paolo serving pilgrims. The Sienese fortified the town, constructing the Palazzo Podestarile, now housing the Museo della Mezzadria <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought prosperity, with Buonconvento’s sharecropping economy supporting Siena’s markets. The 16th-century Palazzo Ricci Socini, built by a prominent Sienese family, reflected the town’s wealth <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. In 1559, Buonconvento fell to the Medici of Florence, marking the end of Sienese independence. The 19th century saw Buonconvento join unified Italy in 1861, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with the decline of sharecropping and emigration. World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting nearby rail lines. Post-war restoration preserved the medieval core, and tourism initiatives, including Via Francigena promotion, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Ombrone have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Museo della Mezzadria, reinforcing Buonconvento’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan trade hub to Sienese stronghold, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
