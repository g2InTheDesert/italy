<p>Buonconvento, a charming walled village in Tuscany’s Val d’Orcia, exudes medieval tranquility amid rolling hills. Its name, meaning “good gathering,” reflects its historic role as a market hub along the Via Francigena. The Museo della Mezzadria showcases rural Tuscan life, while the 14th-century walls and Porta Senese gate preserve its past. Local trattorias serve pici pasta and pecorino cheese, paired with Brunello wines. Buonconvento’s pastoral beauty and quiet authenticity make it a perfect base for exploring southern Tuscany.</p>
