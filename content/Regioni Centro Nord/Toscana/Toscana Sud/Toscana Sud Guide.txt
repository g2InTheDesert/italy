    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Toscana Sud’s history is a saga of ancient tribes, Renaissance splendor, and rural resilience, beginning with Etruscan settlements around 800 BC. The Etruscans established thriving communities in Chiusi and Montepulciano, influencing Roman culture with advanced engineering and art.<sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup> Rome conquered the area by the 3rd century BC, transforming it into a prosperous region with roads like the Via Cassia and villas in the Val d’Orcia.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>The fall of Rome in 476 AD led to Lombard rule, who fortified villages like Castiglione d’Orcia.<sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup> The Middle Ages saw the rise of communes, with Siena dominating the south, and the Battle of Montaperti in 1260 marking victory over Florence.<sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup> The Renaissance (14th–17th centuries) flourished under the Medici, with Pienza redesigned by Pope Pius II as an "ideal Renaissance town" in the 15th century.<sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup></p>

    <p>The Grand Duchy of Tuscany under the Lorraine in the 18th century brought enlightened reforms, including land reclamation in the Val d’Orcia.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The Risorgimento led to unification in 1861, with Toscana Sud contributing through local uprisings in Buonconvento. The 20th century brought industrialization in Siena, but rural areas like Montalcino remained agricultural, with the creation of Brunello wine in the 1880s by Ferruccio Biondi-Santi.<sup><a href="#cite-23">23</a></sup> Post-war economic boom transformed the region, with tourism becoming a major industry after UNESCO designation for Val d’Orcia in 2004 <sup><a href="#cite-24">24</a></sup>. The 1966 flood affected Florence but spared the south. Today, Toscana Sud balances its ancient legacy with modern development, from UNESCO sites to sustainable agriculture. Its history, from Etruscan colonies to wine innovation, underscores its enduring cultural impact.</p>

The 18th-century Lorraine rule brought agricultural reforms, improving yields in Monteroni d’Arbia. The 19th-century unification introduced infrastructure like the Siena-Grosseto railway.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century saw Toscana Sud’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans using the hills around Castiglione d’Orcia for guerrilla warfare. The post-war period brought the "economic miracle," with wine cooperatives in Montalcino. The 1990s saw the rise of agritourism, transforming farmhouses into lodgings in San Quirico d’Orcia. Recent preservation efforts, like the Val d’Orcia landscape management, highlight environmental history <sup><a href="#cite-24">24</a></sup>.
