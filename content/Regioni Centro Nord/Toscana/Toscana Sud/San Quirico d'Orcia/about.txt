<p>San Quirico d’Orcia, a medieval gem in Tuscany’s Val d’Orcia, is a haven of historic charm and pastoral beauty. Its Collegiata di San Quirico, with its Romanesque portals, and the Horti Leonini, a Renaissance garden, highlight its heritage. A stop on the Via Francigena, the village’s stone streets and ancient walls exude timelessness. Surrounded by cypress-dotted hills, San Quirico’s trattorias serve rustic Tuscan fare like ribollita, making it an idyllic base for exploring the UNESCO-listed valley.</p>
