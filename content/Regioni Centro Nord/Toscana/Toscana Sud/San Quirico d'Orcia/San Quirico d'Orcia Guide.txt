<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>San Quirico d’Orcia’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position along the Via Francigena. Likely founded by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Orcia River evidencing early settlement. The name San Quirico honors the martyr Saint Quiricus, reflecting early Christian influence <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 8th century, San Quirico was a Lombard settlement, with the Collegiata di San Quirico established as a parish under the Diocese of Siena. In the 12th century, it became a fortified commune, aligning with Siena against Florence. The 1155 meeting between Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and papal envoys, which secured Siena’s autonomy, marked a pivotal moment, commemorated in the Festa del Barbarossa <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. The 13th century saw the construction of the village’s walls and gates, like the <strong>Porta Nuova</strong>, to protect against regional conflicts.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought prosperity, with San Quirico’s sharecropping economy supporting Siena’s markets. The Horti Leonini, created in 1581, reflected the village’s wealth and cultural aspirations <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. In 1559, San Quirico fell to the Medici of Florence, ending Sienese independence. The 19th century saw the village join unified Italy in 1861, with its olive oil and wine industries gaining prominence.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of sharecropping. World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting nearby roads. Post-war restoration preserved the medieval core, and the Val d’Orcia’s UNESCO designation in 2004 boosted tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Orcia have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in local exhibitions <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. San Quirico d’Orcia’s history, from Etruscan settlement to pilgrimage hub, underscores its enduring cultural significance.</p>
