<p>La Verna, a sacred mountaintop sanctuary in Tuscany’s Casentino Valley, is where St. Francis of Assisi received the stigmata in 1224. Its Franciscan monastery, nestled in dense beech forests, draws pilgrims to its serene chapels and the dramatic Sasso Spicco. The sanctuary’s museum displays Franciscan relics, while trails offer meditative walks with panoramic vistas. La Verna’s spiritual aura, coupled with its natural beauty and simple Tuscan fare, makes it a profound retreat for reflection and connection with nature.</p>
