<p>Lucca, a walled city in Tuscany, enchants with its intact Renaissance ramparts, now a tree-lined promenade for cycling and strolls. The oval Piazza dell’Anfiteatro, built on a Roman amphitheater, buzzes with cafes, while the Romanesque San Michele in Foro and Guinigi Tower, topped with oak trees, are iconic. Lucca’s musical legacy, tied to Puccini, shines during its summer festival. With its elegant streets, local olive oil, and proximity to Versilia’s beaches, Lucca offers a refined yet relaxed Tuscan experience.</p>
