<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Lucca’s history is a rich tapestry, weaving together Etruscan, Roman, and medieval influences. Founded by the Etruscans around 500 BC, Lucca became a Roman colony in 180 BC, serving as an administrative and trade hub. The <strong>Piazza dell’Anfiteatro</strong>, built on the site of a Roman amphitheater, retains its oval shape, now surrounded by medieval buildings that create a picturesque square <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>During the Middle Ages, Lucca flourished as an independent republic, maintaining its autonomy until 1847. This period of self-governance allowed the city to develop its unique character, rivaling Florence and Pisa in wealth and power. The <strong>16th-17th century city walls</strong>, stretching over 4 kilometers with 10 bastions, are a testament to Lucca’s strategic importance. Designed for defense, these walls are now a public park, offering a 4-km promenade for walking or biking <sup><a href="#cite-15">15</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought significant architectural development, including the <strong>Palazzo Ducale</strong> in <strong>Piazza Napoleone</strong>, which now houses the National Picture Gallery. The <strong>Guinigi Tower</strong>, topped with a unique garden of Holm oaks, was built by the powerful Guinigi family and remains a symbol of Lucca’s prosperity. Visitors can climb the tower for €4.50 to enjoy panoramic views <sup><a href="#cite-16">16</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Lucca’s religious heritage is evident in the <strong>Basilica of San Frediano</strong>, with its green and white marble facade and a 13th-century mosaic. The basilica’s interior includes artworks like the *Fontana Lustrale* by Matteo Civitali, reflecting Lucca’s Renaissance artistry <sup><a href="#cite-17">17</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In the 19th century, Lucca was annexed to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany under Napoleon’s influence, becoming part of unified Italy in 1860. The city’s historical legacy is preserved in its architecture and cultural institutions, making it a haven for history enthusiasts.</p>
