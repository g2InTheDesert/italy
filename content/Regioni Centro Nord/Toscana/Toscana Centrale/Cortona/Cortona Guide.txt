<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Cortona’s history spans over 3,000 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins as one of the 12 cities of the Etruscan League. Founded around the 8th century BC, Cortona (known as *Corythus*) was a powerful Etruscan city-state, with archaeological finds like the Tabula Cortonensis evidencing its prosperity <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>. Under Roman rule from the 4th century BC, Cortona became a colony (*Corton*), thriving along the Via Cassia, with structures like the Roman villa in Ossaia.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Duomo built over an Etruscan temple. The Middle Ages saw Cortona as a free commune in the 12th century, aligning with the Ghibellines against Guelph rivals. The Battle of Campaldino in 1289 saw Cortona support Arezzo against Florence. The 14th century brought prosperity under the Casali family, with the construction of Palazzo Casali <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>. The 16th century saw Cortona under Florentine control, losing independence but preserving its heritage <sup><a href="#cite-15">15</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with Luca Signorelli born in Cortona, influencing European art. The 19th century saw Cortona join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture. The 20th century brought tourism, with Frances Mayes’ 1996 book "Under the Tuscan Sun" boosting global fame. The 1944 World War II bombings caused minor damage to the historic center, repaired by 1950. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Cortona Antiquaria, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-16">16</a></sup>. Recent excavations near the Etruscan walls have uncovered artifacts, displayed in the MAEC <sup><a href="#cite-17">17</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan city to artistic center, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Cortona’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a trade and religious center. The Etruscan period left tombs like the Tanella di Pitagora, while the Roman era introduced aqueducts and roads. The contrade system originated in the Middle Ages, influencing local festivals. The town’s rivalry with Arezzo and Florence shaped its defensive walls. Cortona’s preservation of its Etruscan and medieval heritage makes it a living testament to Tuscany’s layered history.</p>
