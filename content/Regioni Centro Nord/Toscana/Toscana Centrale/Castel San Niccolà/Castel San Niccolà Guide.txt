    <h2 class="guide-section-header">Culture</h2>
    
    <p>Castel San Niccolò is renowned as the “Land of the Handworked Stone,” a title earned through centuries of quarrying and crafting serena stone, a durable sandstone integral to Tuscan architecture. The <strong>Museo della pietra lavorata – Centro d’interpretazione Ecomuseo della Pietra</strong>, located in the former Seminary of Strada, is a cultural cornerstone. This museum documents the history and techniques of stone working, displaying tools like chisels and hammers, as well as finished works ranging from building blocks to intricate sculptures. It highlights the stone’s use in notable structures like Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio and Uffizi Gallery, offering visitors a deep dive into this artisanal tradition [1].</p>

    <p>Every two years, in September, the town hosts the <strong>Exhibition of the Handworked Stone</strong>, a significant cultural event that attracts stonemasons and sculptors from across Italy. This exhibition features live demonstrations, showcasing the skill of carving serena stone, and allows visitors to purchase unique pieces. It not only preserves the local craft but also fosters innovation, with artists experimenting with new designs, ensuring the tradition remains vibrant [2].</p>

    <p>Other cultural landmarks include the <strong>Pieve di San Martino a Vado</strong>, an 11th-century Romanesque church known for its intricate facade and historical frescoes, reflecting its role as a spiritual and artistic hub. The frescoes depict scenes from the Bible and local history, providing insight into the artistic styles and religious practices of the time. The <strong>Logge del Grano</strong>, a 16th-century covered market in Piazza Matteotti, adds to the town’s architectural charm with its five arches, hosting various events and exhibitions. Its Renaissance design, adapted to local needs, makes it a versatile cultural space [3].</p>

    <p>The <strong>Oratorio della Visitazione della Madonna</strong>, with its painting by Santi di Tito, a mannerist artist active in Florence during the late 16th century, adds to the town’s artistic heritage. This painting is a point of interest for art historians and enthusiasts. The <strong>Torre dell’Orologio</strong> (Clock Tower), featuring a unique 24-hour dial, reflects the town’s historical approach to timekeeping, designed to align with agricultural schedules based on daylight hours rather than the standard 12-hour cycle [4].</p>

    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>The history of Castel San Niccolò is deeply intertwined with the Castle of the Counts Guidi, first mentioned in documents from 1029. This medieval fortress, known as Corte di Vado, was strategically located on a hill overlooking the Solano stream, a tributary of the Arno River. The castle served as a key stronghold for the powerful Guidi family, who controlled much of the Casentino valley during the Middle Ages. The Guidi Counts were key players in medieval Tuscan politics, often aligning with either the Guelphs or Ghibellines, and their castle was a symbol of their dominance [5].</p>

    <p>In 1349, the inhabitants rebelled against Count Galeotto, known for his tyranny, and submitted to the Florentine Republic, marking a shift in power. From the 15th century, Castel San Niccolò became part of Florence’s territories, administered directly by the city-state. A pivotal event occurred in 1440 during a siege led by Niccolò Piccinino, a condottiero for the Visconti of Milan. The castle’s defenders resisted fiercely, but Piccinino’s troops breached the walls, leading to brutal reprisals, with many inhabitants executed or hanged. This event, one of the bloodiest in Casentino’s history, prompted the Florentine Republic to dismantle the castle in 1442, shifting village life to the area around the church of San Martino a Vado [6].</p>

    <p>After the castle was dismantled, its stones were reused to build other structures in the area, including parts of the village of Strada in Casentino, a common practice in medieval architecture reflecting practicality and resourcefulness. In 1776, under Grand Duke Leopold’s regulations, Borgo alla Collina was added to the municipality, expanding its territory. The town was united with Arezzo in 1859, and its current structure, including villages like Caiano, Ristonchi, Battifolle, and Vertelli, was established in 1868. Today, the restored castle, open by appointment, offers guided tours of its mastio, tower with 15th-century bifore, loggia, cistern, and defensive walls, providing a tangible link to its storied past [7].</p>

The local economy is diverse, with agriculture, tourism, and traditional crafts forming its backbone. The cultivation of Christmas trees (abete) is significant, with farms supplying trees for the holiday season across Italy and Europe, supporting local farmers economically [8].</p>

The biennial <strong>Mostra della Pietra Lavorata</strong> further enhances cultural tourism, showcasing stone-working artistry [9].</p>

    <p>Piazza Matteotti in Strada in Casentino is the social hub, surrounded by historic buildings like the Vettori and Vettori-Tommasi palaces and the Logge del Grano.
