<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Pisa’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins. Founded around the 5th century BC as a coastal settlement, Pisa was a key Etruscan port, with archaeological finds like the necropolis near Marina di Pisa evidencing early prosperity <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-19">19</a></sup>. Under Roman rule from the 2nd century BC, Pisa became a colony (*Colonia Opsequens Julia Pisana*), thriving as a naval base with the Portus Pisanus <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Pisa emerge as a maritime republic in the 11th century, rivaling Genoa and Venice. The construction of the Duomo and Leaning Tower in Piazza dei Miracoli symbolized Pisa’s wealth from trade with the East <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The Battle of Meloria in 1284 against Genoa marked Pisa’s decline, with Florence conquering it in 1406. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with Galileo Galilei teaching at the University of Pisa in the 16th century <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 19th century saw Siena join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture and tourism. The 20th century brought challenges, with World War II bombings damaging the Camposanto, repaired by 1950. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Luminara di San Ranieri and UNESCO designation for Piazza dei Miracoli in 1987, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent restorations of the Leaning Tower (completed in 2001) have stabilized the structure, attracting millions annually <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan port to maritime republic, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Pisa’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a trade and scientific center. The maritime republic’s navy dominated the Mediterranean, with the invention of the nautical compass attributed to Pisan sailors. The university, founded in 1343, nurtured scientists like Galileo, who conducted experiments from the Leaning Tower. The 15th-century Florentine domination shifted Pisa’s economy to agriculture. Pisa’s preservation of its medieval and Roman heritage makes it a living testament to Tuscany’s layered history.</p>
