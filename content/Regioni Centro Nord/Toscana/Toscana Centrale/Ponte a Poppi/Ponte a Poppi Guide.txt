    <h2 class="guide-section-header">Culture</h2>
    
    <p>Ponte a Poppi’s cultural landscape is deeply rooted in its medieval heritage, enriched by its proximity to Poppi and the broader Casentino valley. The village is closely associated with the <strong>Poppi Castle</strong> (Castello dei Conti Guidi), a 13th-century fortress that dominates the region’s skyline. Built by the Guidi family, the castle is a cultural cornerstone, featuring a courtyard with a splendid staircase, a chapel adorned with 14th-century frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi (a pupil of Giotto), and the Rilliana Library, which houses over 25,000 volumes, including rare manuscripts and incunabula. The castle’s architectural significance is notable, as it served as a prototype for Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio. Visitors can explore the castle for €7, with guided tours available to delve into its artistic and historical treasures [1].</p>

    <p>In Ponte a Poppi itself, the <strong>Convento dei Frati Minori Cappuccini e Chiesa del Sacro Cuore di Gesù</strong> is a significant cultural landmark. Founded by Guido Novello in the 13th century to commemorate the Ghibelline victory at Montaperti (1260), this convent and church reflect the village’s religious heritage. The church houses artworks that add to its cultural value, making it a point of interest for visitors [2].</p>

    <p>Nearby, the <strong>Pieve di San Pietro a Romena</strong>, located about 10 kilometers from Ponte a Poppi, is a Romanesque church dating back to 1152. Its stone architecture and historical frescoes make it a cultural highlight, offering insight into the region’s medieval artistry. The <strong>Castle of Romena</strong>, an 11th-century ruin, further enhances the area’s cultural appeal, with its evocative towers set against the Casentino landscape [3].</p>

    <p>Cultural events play a vital role in Ponte a Poppi’s identity. The <strong>Gusto dei Guidi</strong> festival, held annually in August, is a major draw, celebrating Tuscan wine and Casentino food products. This event provides access to historic venues like wine cellars and gardens, typically closed to the public, offering a unique cultural experience. Visitors can enjoy tastings, artisan demonstrations, and performances that highlight the region’s traditions [4].</p>

    <p>The <strong>Foreste Casentinesi National Park</strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, adds a natural dimension to the cultural landscape. Spanning the Apennines between Tuscany and Romagna, the park offers guided tours, educational programs, and trails that showcase its biodiversity, including wolves and golden eagles. The <strong>Parco Zoo della Fauna Europea</strong>, located in Poppi, is another cultural attraction, featuring native species like otters and lynx across 50 hectares, making it a family-friendly destination [5].</p>

    <p>The <strong>Oratorio della Madonna del Morbo</strong>, a 17th-century hexagonal church in Poppi’s Piazza Amerighi, is a rare example of Tuscan late Baroque architecture. It houses a painting of the Virgin attributed to Filippino Lippi, adding to the region’s artistic heritage. These cultural landmarks and events make Ponte a Poppi a vibrant destination for those seeking to immerse themselves in Tuscany’s medieval and natural splendor [6].</p>

<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Ponte a Poppi’s history is closely tied to the broader history of Poppi and the Casentino valley, shaped by the powerful Guidi family. The village’s name, meaning “Bridge at Poppi,” derives from its medieval bridge over the Arno River, a vital trade and travel link since ancient times. Ponte a Poppi developed as a market area (mercatale) for the Poppi Castle, which was first documented in 1169 when it belonged to the Abbey of San Fidele de Strumi. By the 1190s, the castle had passed to the Guidi Counts, who controlled the Casentino for over 350 years, ruling from castles like Romena and Porciano [7].</p>

    <p>The Poppi Castle, constructed in the second half of the 13th century with additions by Arnolfo di Cambio, was a symbol of the Guidi’s power. The castle’s tower and keep, along with its elegant mullioned windows added by Count Simone Guidi, reflect its medieval grandeur. The castle was central to significant historical events, including the <strong>Battle of Campaldino</strong> in 1289, where Dante Alighieri fought among the Guelphs against the Ghibellines, and the <strong>Battle of Anghiari</strong> in 1440, which led to the Guidi’s exile and Florentine rule over Poppi until Italy’s unification in 1860 [8].</p>

    <p>Ponte a Poppi’s role as a market hub grew over time, with the village expanding in the modern era while preserving its historical core. The <strong>Convento dei Cappuccini</strong>, established to commemorate the 1260 Battle of Montaperti, underscores the village’s historical significance. During World War II, the nearby Villa Ascensione, originally a 16th-century Capuchin convent, served as a prisoner-of-war camp for Allied officers, primarily New Zealanders, in 1942, adding a modern historical layer [9].</p>

    <p>The <strong>Pieve di San Pietro a Romena</strong> and <strong>Castle of Romena</strong>, located nearby, further highlight the region’s medieval past. The pieve’s Romanesque architecture and the castle’s ruins are remnants of the Guidi’s influence, offering visitors a tangible connection to the area’s history [10].</p>
