<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Siena’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins. Founded around the 9th century BC by the Etruscans as a hilltop settlement, Siena (possibly derived from the Etruscan family name *Saina*) became a Roman colony in the 1st century BC, thriving along the Via Cassia <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-19">19</a></sup>. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Cattedrale built over a Roman temple.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Siena emerge as a free commune in the 12th century, rivaling Florence in trade and banking. The Battle of Montaperti in 1260 saw Siena defeat Florence, leading to a golden age with the construction of the Palazzo Pubblico and Piazza del Campo <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. The 14th century brought prosperity and the Black Death, which halved the population, followed by the construction of the Duomo’s facade. Siena fell under Florentine control in 1555, losing independence but preserving its heritage <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought artistic growth, with the Sienese School of painting, led by Duccio and Simone Martini, influencing European art. The 19th century saw Siena join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture and banking. The 20th century brought tourism, with the Palio gaining international fame. The 1966 flood caused minor damage, repaired by 1970. Post-war initiatives, including UNESCO designation for the historic center in 1995, boosted the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent restorations of the Duomo’s floor mosaics have uncovered medieval artifacts, displayed in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, reinforcing Siena’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan settlement to medieval republic, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Siena’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a banking and trade center. The Monte dei Paschi di Siena, founded in 1472, is the world’s oldest bank, shaping European finance. The contrade system originated in the Middle Ages, with the Palio dating to 1633. The city’s rivalry with Florence influenced its Gothic architecture, distinct from Florentine Renaissance style. Siena’s preservation of its medieval walls and squares makes it a living testament to Tuscany’s layered history.</p>
