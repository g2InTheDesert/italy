At the forefront of its cultural offerings is the <strong>Sanctuary of Santa Maria del Sasso</strong>, a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture designed by Giuliano da Majano, located just a kilometer from the town center. This sanctuary is renowned for its collection of sacred art, including a *Madonna with Child* by Bicci di Lorenzo, a *Nativity* by Ligozzi, and a stunning *Assumption* by Fra Bartolomeo and Fra Paolino del Signoraccio. The sanctuary’s architecture, with its harmonious proportions and elegant details, embodies the artistic ideals of the Renaissance, making it a must-visit for art enthusiasts. The site also features a unique boulder, the “Sasso,” integrated into a lower church housing the *Madonna del Buio*, a wooden sculpture from the school of Donatello, adding to its spiritual and artistic allure <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In the heart of Bibbiena, the <strong>Chiesa di San Lorenzo</strong> stands as another cultural landmark. This church houses two large terracotta works by Andrea della Robbia, *Adoration of the Shepherds* and *Deposition*, celebrated for their emotional depth and technical skill.

<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Bibbiena’s history is a fascinating journey through time, from its ancient origins to its modern-day charm. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was inhabited as early as the 7th century BC by the Etruscans, who left behind tombs and artifacts in the surrounding countryside. The town’s name, derived from the Latin “Bivium” (crossroads), reflects its strategic location at the intersection of trade routes <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>During the Roman era, Bibbiena was part of the province of Tuscia, benefiting from Roman infrastructure such as roads and bridges that facilitated trade between Florence and Arezzo. The town’s strategic importance continued into the Middle Ages, when it became a feudal stronghold under the Tarlati family, who built a castle that served as a defensive and administrative center. Bibbiena aligned with Arezzo and the Ghibelline faction during the Guelph-Ghibelline conflicts, leading to tensions with Florence. In 1289, following the Ghibelline defeat at the Battle of Campaldino, Bibbiena faced a punitive expedition by the Florentines, who sacked the town and damaged its castle <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 14th century, Bibbiena came under Florentine control, marking a period of cultural and economic growth. The town became known for its wool industry and textile production, contributing to its prosperity. The Renaissance brought further development, with the construction of significant buildings like the <strong>Palazzo Dovizi</strong>, commissioned by Cardinal Bernardo Dovizi, a native of Bibbiena who rose to prominence in the Medici court. Dovizi, known as “Il Bibbiena,” served as secretary to Pope Leo X and authored *La Calandria*, a comedy that reflected the sophistication of Renaissance society. His palace, with its elegant architecture, remains a testament to his influence <sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 16th and 17th centuries saw the construction of churches and public buildings, with religious orders establishing a strong presence in Bibbiena. The town’s religious life flourished, as evidenced by the artworks in the Sanctuary of Santa Maria del Sasso and the Chiesa di San Lorenzo. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Bibbiena was part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany under the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, later joining the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 following unification. The 1860 plebiscite for annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia showed mixed support, with only 761 of 1,570 eligible voters favoring unification, indicating some local resistance <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, particularly during World War II, when Bibbiena was occupied by German forces. The town played a role in the resistance movement, with nearby areas like Partina and Moscaio affected by German operations against partisans in 1944. Liberation by Allied troops marked the beginning of postwar reconstruction, which modernized the town while preserving its historical core <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Today, Bibbiena’s historical heritage is evident in its well-preserved architecture and cultural institutions, offering visitors a window into its storied past.</p>
