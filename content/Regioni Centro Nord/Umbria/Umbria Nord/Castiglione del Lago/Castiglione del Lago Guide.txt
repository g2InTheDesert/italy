<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Castiglione del Lago’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its strategic position on Lake Trasimeno. Founded by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, Castiglione was a key settlement, with archaeological finds like cinerary urns and bronze tools near the lake evidencing its prosperity. The name Castiglione, from Latin *castellum* (small fortress), reflects its defensive role <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Castiglione, known as *Clusium Novum*, thrived along the Via Flaminia, with a port facilitating trade. The <strong>Battle of Lake Trasimeno</strong> (217 BC), where Hannibal defeated the Romans, occurred nearby, marking its strategic significance <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with early churches established. In the 12th century, Castiglione became a free commune under Perugia, with the Rocca del Leone built in 1247 to protect against regional conflicts. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 30 kilometers away, saw Castiglione support Perugia against Assisi <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Castiglione flourish under the Della Corgna family, who built the Palazzo della Corgna in the 16th century, marking a Renaissance peak <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. In the 17th century, it fell under the Papal States, with its fishing and agricultural economy thriving. The 19th century saw Castiglione join unified Italy in 1860, with its lake-based economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional fishing. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to the Rocca, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Castiglione major damage, with partisan activity in the Trasimeno hills. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Rocca and festival promotion, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the lake have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Castiglione’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan settlement to medieval stronghold, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
