<p>Castiglione del Lago, a fortified town on Lake Trasimeno’s shores in Umbria, blends medieval grandeur with lakeside charm. Its Rocca del Leone, a pentagonal fortress, and Palazzo della Corgna, with frescoed halls, reflect its Renaissance past. The town’s promenade buzzes with cafes serving lake fish like regina carp, while ferries connect to Isola Maggiore. Known for its olive oil and Trasimeno wine festival, Castiglione’s scenic beauty and historic allure make it a gem for Umbrian explorers.</p>
