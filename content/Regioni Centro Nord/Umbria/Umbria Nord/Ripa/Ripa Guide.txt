<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Ripa’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Tiber Valley. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Tiber River evidencing early settlement. The name Ripa, possibly from Latin *ripa* (riverbank), reflects its location along the Tiber <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Ripa, part of *Perusia* (modern Perugia), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting the city’s markets. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Martino established as a parish in the 13th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Ripa was under Perugia’s control, a powerful commune aligned against regional rivals. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 20 kilometers away, saw Perugia’s forces, including Ripa, defeat Assisi, reinforcing regional dominance <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Ripa develop as an agricultural center, with its truffles and wine supplying Umbrian markets. The Castello di Ripa, built in the 12th century, protected the valley against conflicts. In the 14th century, Ripa fell under the Papal States, with Perugia’s Palazzo dei Priori serving as a regional hub <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes added to local churches. The 19th century saw Ripa join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to San Martino, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Ripa major damage, with partisan activity in the nearby Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including truffle festivals and proximity to Perugia’s attractions, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Tiber have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in Perugia’s Galleria Nazionale, reinforcing Ripa’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to rural hamlet, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
