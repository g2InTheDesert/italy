<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Nocera Umbra’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its strategic position in the Topino Valley. Founded by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, Nocera (known as *Noukria*) was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Topino River evidencing early settlement. Under Roman rule, Nocera, renamed *Nuceria Camellaria*, thrived along the Via Flaminia, with a forum and baths supporting its economy. The Roman bridge over the Topino, partially preserved, facilitated trade with Rome <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta established as a parish. In the 12th century, Nocera became a free commune, aligning with Perugia against regional rivals. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 15 kilometers away, saw Nocera support Perugia against Assisi, reinforcing its strategic role <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 13th century brought prosperity, with the Torre Civica and Convento di San Francesco built as civic and religious hubs. In the 14th century, Nocera fell under the Papal States, with its mineral springs gaining fame for therapeutic properties <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with artists like Matteo da Gualdo adorning local churches. The 19th century saw Nocera join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural and spa economy peaking <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 20th century brought challenges, with the 1997 Umbria earthquake severely damaging the historic center, including the Cattedrale and Torre Civica, with repairs completed by 2005. World War II caused minor damage, with partisan activity in the Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the truffle festival and spa revitalization, boosted the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Topino have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico, reinforcing Nocera Umbra’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to medieval stronghold, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
