    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Umbria Nord's history is a saga of ancient tribes, spiritual revolutions, and rural resilience, beginning with Umbri settlements around 1000 BC.

The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Perugia, while rural areas like Piccione focused on truffles.
