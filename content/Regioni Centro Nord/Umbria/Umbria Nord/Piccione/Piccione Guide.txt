<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Piccione’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Tiber Valley. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Tiber River evidencing early settlement. The name Piccione, possibly derived from *picio* (a local term for pigeon or dove), reflects its peaceful setting or local fauna <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Piccione, part of *Perusia* (modern Perugia), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting the city’s markets. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista established as a parish in the 14th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Piccione was under Perugia’s control, a powerful commune aligned against regional rivals. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 25 kilometers away, saw Perugia’s forces, including Piccione, defeat Assisi, reinforcing regional dominance <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Piccione develop as an agricultural center, with its olive oil and wine supplying Umbrian markets. The Castello di Piccione, built in the 13th century, protected the valley against conflicts. In the 14th century, Piccione fell under the Papal States, with Perugia’s Palazzo dei Priori serving as a regional hub <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes added to local churches. The 19th century saw Piccione join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to San Giovanni Battista, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Piccione major damage, with partisan activity in the nearby Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including local festivals and proximity to Perugia’s attractions, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Tiber have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in Perugia’s Galleria Nazionale, reinforcing Piccione’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to rural hamlet, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
