<p>Perugia, Umbria’s vibrant capital, blends Etruscan roots with a lively university scene. Its hilltop Corso Vannucci buzzes with cafes, leading to the Gothic Palazzo dei Priori and Fontana Maggiore. The Rocca Paolina, an underground fortress, and San Lorenzo’s cathedral add historic depth, while the Eurochocolate festival and Umbria Jazz draw crowds. Perugia’s cuisine, from Baci chocolates to strangozzi al tartufo, delights. A cultural hub surrounded by green hills, Perugia is Umbria’s beating heart.</p>
