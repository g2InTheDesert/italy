    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Perugia’s history spans over 3,000 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins as one of Umbria’s oldest cities. Founded around the 8th century BC by the Etruscans, Perugia (known as *Perusia*) was a fortified hilltop city, with archaeological finds like cinerary urns and the Arco Etrusco evidencing its prosperity. Under Roman rule, Perugia became a key municipium in the 3rd century BC, thriving along the Via Flaminia. The <strong>Battle of Perusia</strong> (41–40 BC) saw Octavian besiege the city, marking its Roman significance <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with Saint Lawrence’s martyrdom establishing the Cattedrale di San Lorenzo. In the 12th century, Perugia emerged as a powerful free commune, aligning against regional rivals. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 20 kilometers away, saw Perugia defeat Assisi, reinforcing its dominance <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 14th century brought prosperity, with the Palazzo dei Priori symbolizing civic pride. In the 16th century, Perugia fell under the Papal States after the <strong>Salt War</strong> (1540), with the Rocca Paolina built to assert control <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance saw cultural growth, with Perugino’s school of painting flourishing. The 19th century saw Perugia join unified Italy in 1860, with its university and chocolate industry peaking <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 20th century brought challenges, with the 1997 Umbria earthquake damaging the Cattedrale and Palazzo dei Priori, repaired by 2000. World War II caused minor damage, with partisan activity in the Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Umbria Jazz and Eurochocolate festivals, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Arco Etrusco have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Perugia’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>.
