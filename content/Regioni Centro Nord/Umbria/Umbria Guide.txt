<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Umbria’s history is a saga of ancient tribes, spiritual revolutions, and rural resilience, beginning with Umbri settlements around 1000 BC. The Umbri, an Italic tribe, established hilltop towns like Perugia and Assisi, influencing Roman culture with religious practices. Rome conquered Umbria by the 3rd century BC, transforming it with roads like the Via Flaminia and villas near Spello.</p>

    <p>The fall of Rome in 476 AD led to Lombard rule, who fortified villages like Gubbio. The Middle Ages saw the rise of communes, with Perugia dominating, and the Battle of Pian del Carpine in 1202 marking victory over Assisi. The 13th century brought the Franciscan movement, with San Francesco founding his order in Assisi, revolutionizing Christianity. The Papal States controlled Umbria from the 16th century, with reforms in the 18th century improving agriculture in Terni.</p>

    <p>The Risorgimento led to unification in 1860, with Umbria joining the Kingdom of Italy after Perugia’s uprising. The 20th century brought industrialization in Foligno, but rural areas like Norcia remained agricultural. The 1997 earthquake damaged Assisi’s basilica, restored by 2000, and the 2016 earthquake heavily impacted Norcia, prompting ongoing reconstruction <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Post-war economic boom transformed Umbria, with tourism becoming a major industry after UNESCO designation for Assisi in 2000 <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. The 2016 earthquake affected Norcia, but reconstruction continues. Today, Umbria balances its ancient legacy with modern development, from UNESCO sites to sustainable agriculture. Its history, from Umbri tribes to spiritual cradle, underscores its enduring cultural impact.</p>

    <p>Umbria’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a cultural crossroads. The Umbri introduced advanced agriculture, while Romans built theaters in Spello. The medieval period saw Perugia as a banking center, influencing European finance. The Franciscan movement fostered humanism, with San Francesco’s teachings spreading globally. The 18th-century papal rule brought land reforms, improving yields near Lake Trasimeno. The 19th-century unification introduced infrastructure like the Perugia-Terni railway. The 20th century saw Umbria’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans using the hills around Norcia for guerrilla warfare. The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Terni, while rural areas focused on olive oil. Recent preservation efforts, like the Sibillini National Park, highlight ecological history <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. Umbria’s history, marked by spiritual depth and cultural preservation, continues to define its identity.</p>

    <p>The region’s historical significance extends to its role in art, with Perugia’s Collegio del Cambio frescoes by Perugino. The 1997 earthquake prompted global support for Assisi’s restoration. Umbria’s history, blending spiritual innovation and rural continuity, offers a living testament to its layered past.</p>
