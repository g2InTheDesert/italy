<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Ficulle’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Chiani Valley. Likely settled by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, Ficulle was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery, cinerary urns, and tombs near the Chiani River evidencing its prosperity. The name Ficulle, possibly from the Latin *ficus* (fig tree) or *figulus* (potter), reflects its agricultural and terracotta traditions <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Ficulle, part of the *Tuder* region (modern Todi), thrived as an agricultural and pottery-producing outpost, with kilns supplying terracotta to nearby Orvieto and Rome. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di Santa Maria Nuova established as a parish in the 13th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Ficulle was a fortified commune under Orvieto’s influence, with the Castello di Ficulle built to protect against regional conflicts. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 40 kilometers away, saw Orvieto’s forces support Perugia, with Ficulle contributing resources <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Ficulle flourish as a terracotta and agricultural center, with its pottery and wine production supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the Palazzo della Corgna serving as a civic hub <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with local families commissioning frescoes for churches. The 19th century saw Ficulle join unified Italy in 1860, with its terracotta industry peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional crafts. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to Santa Maria Nuova, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Ficulle major damage, with partisan activity in the nearby Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Museo delle Terracotte and wine routes, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Chiani River have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo delle Terracotte, reinforcing Ficulle’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan settlement to terracotta hub, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
