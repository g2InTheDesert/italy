<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Bastardo’s history is a quiet yet compelling narrative of medieval origins, agricultural resilience, and regional significance, shaped by its position in the Martani Hills. Likely founded by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Nestore River evidencing early settlement. The name Bastardo, possibly derived from a local landowner or a corruption of *bastum* (fortified place), reflects its medieval roots <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Bastardo, part of the broader *Marcianum* region, thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting nearby Todi and Perugia. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Michele Arcangelo established as a parish in the 14th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Bastardo was under the control of Giano dell’Umbria, a fortified commune aligned with Perugia. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought nearby, saw Giano’s forces support Perugia against Assisi, with Bastardo contributing resources <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Bastardo develop as an agricultural center, with its olive oil and wine production supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the Palazzo del Bargello in Giano dell’Umbria serving as a regional hub. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with the Chiesa di San Francesco in Giano reflecting the area’s growth <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Bastardo join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting nearby rail lines. Post-war restoration preserved Bastardo’s medieval core, and tourism initiatives, including olive oil and wine routes, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Martani Hills have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico di Giano dell’Umbria, reinforcing Bastardo’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to agricultural hub, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
