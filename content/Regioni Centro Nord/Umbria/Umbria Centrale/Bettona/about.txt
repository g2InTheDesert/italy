<p>Bettona, an Etruscan hilltop village in Umbria, offers panoramic views of the Assisi Valley and Monte Subasio. Its intact 4th-century BC walls and medieval gates, like Porta Vittorio Emanuele, reflect its ancient roots. The Piazza Cavour, with the Palazzo del Podestà, is a charming hub, while local olive oils and Grechetto wines shine in trattorias. Bettona’s quiet streets, historic charm, and proximity to Perugia make it a serene base for exploring Umbria’s cultural and natural beauty.</p>
