<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Bettona’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins as one of Umbria’s oldest settlements. Founded around the 8th century BC by the Etruscans, Bettona (known as *Vettona*) was a fortified hilltop city, with archaeological finds like cinerary urns and bronze tools near the Chiascio River evidencing its prosperity. The Etruscan walls, partially preserved, are among Umbria’s oldest <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Bettona, renamed *Vettona*, thrived along the Via Flaminia, with a forum and baths supporting its economy. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Crispolto established to honor the martyr saint. In the 12th century, Bettona became a free commune under Perugia, fortifying its medieval walls against regional conflicts. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 20 kilometers away, saw Bettona support Perugia against Assisi <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Bettona flourish as an agricultural center, with olive oil and wine production supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the Palazzo del Podestà serving as a civic hub. The Renaissance brought prosperity, with frescoes by Perugino adorning local churches <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Bettona join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to Santa Maria Maggiore, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Bettona major damage, with partisan activity in the nearby Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including Etruscan site promotion, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Chiascio have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo della Città, reinforcing Bettona’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan stronghold to medieval village, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
