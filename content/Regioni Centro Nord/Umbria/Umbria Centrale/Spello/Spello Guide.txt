<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Spello’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its Roman and Etruscan origins. Founded by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, Spello (known as *Hispellum*) was later settled by the Etruscans, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near Monte Subasio evidencing early settlement. Under Roman rule, Spello became a flourishing colony in the 1st century BC, granted the title *Colonia Julia Hispellum* by Augustus. The Porta Consolare, amphitheater, and Villa dei Mosaici reflect its Roman prosperity <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di Santa Maria Maggiore established as a parish. In the 12th century, Spello became a free commune, aligning with Perugia against regional powers. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202) saw Spello support Perugia against Assisi, reinforcing its strategic role <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 13th century brought prosperity, with the construction of medieval walls and churches like Sant’Andrea. In the 14th century, Spello fell under the Papal States, with the Palazzo dei Canonici serving as a civic hub <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with Pinturicchio’s frescoes in the Cappella Baglioni elevating Spello’s artistic profile <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Spello join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking. The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to Santa Maria Maggiore, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Spello major damage, with partisan activity in Monte Subasio. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Infiorate and Villa dei Mosaici, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Villa dei Mosaici have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Pinacoteca Civica, reinforcing Spello’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Roman colony to medieval village, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
