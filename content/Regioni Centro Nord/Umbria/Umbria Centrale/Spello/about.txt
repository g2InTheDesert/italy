<p>Spello, Umbria’s flower-decked hilltop village, is a medieval gem famed for its Infiorata, when streets become floral carpets for Corpus Domini. Its Roman gates, like Porta Consolare, and the Baglioni Chapel’s Pinturicchio frescoes in Santa Maria Maggiore, are artistic treasures. Spello’s alleys brim with olive oil shops and wine bars serving local Sagrantino. Nestled below Monte Subasio, its truffle-rich cuisine and proximity to Assisi make Spello a romantic haven for art lovers and nature lovers.</p>
