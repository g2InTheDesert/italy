<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>San Venanzo’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its volcanic landscape and strategic position in the Monti Martani. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Tiber River evidencing early settlement. The name San Venanzo derives from Saint Venantius, a 3rd-century martyr, reflecting early Christian influence <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, San Venanzo, part of the *Tuder* region (modern Todi), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting nearby markets. Volcanic activity shaped the region, leaving deposits studied today in the Parco Vulcanologico <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Venanzio established as a parish in the 13th century. In the 12th century, San Venanzo was under Todi’s control, a fortified commune aligned with Perugia. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 30 kilometers away, saw Todi’s forces support Perugia against Assisi, with San Venanzo contributing resources <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw San Venanzo develop as an agricultural center, with its olive oil and wine production supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the Chiesa di Santa Maria in Cima reflecting the area’s growth <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with local families commissioning frescoes for churches. The 19th century saw San Venanzo join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to San Venanzio’s bell tower, repaired by 2000. World War II spared San Venanzo major damage, with partisan activity in the Monti Martani. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Parco Vulcanologico and olive oil routes, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Tiber have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Parco Vulcanologico museum, reinforcing San Venanzo’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to volcanic hub, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
