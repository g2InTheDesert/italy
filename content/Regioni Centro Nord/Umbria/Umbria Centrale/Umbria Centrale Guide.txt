    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Umbria Centrale’s history is a saga of ancient tribes, spiritual revolutions, and rural resilience, beginning with Umbri settlements around 1000 BC. The Umbri, an Italic tribe, established hilltop towns like Assisi and Foligno, influencing Roman culture with their religious practices.<sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup> Rome conquered Umbria by the 3rd century BC, transforming it into a prosperous region with roads like the Via Flaminia and villas near Spello.<sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup></p>

    <p>The fall of Rome in 476 AD led to Lombard rule, who fortified villages like Todi.<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup> The Middle Ages saw the rise of communes, with Foligno emerging as a trade hub, and the Battle of Pian del Carpine in 1202 marking Perugia’s victory over Assisi.<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup> The 13th century brought the Franciscan movement, with San Francesco founding his order in Assisi, revolutionizing Christianity with teachings of poverty and nature.<sup><a href="#cite-28">28</a></sup></p>

    <p>The Papal States controlled Umbria from the 16th century, with reforms in the 18th century improving agriculture in Marsciano. The Risorgimento led to unification in 1860, with Umbria joining the Kingdom of Italy after Foligno’s uprising.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century brought industrialization in Foligno, but rural areas like Valtopina remained agricultural, with the 1997 earthquake damaging Assisi’s basilica, restored by 2000 <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Post-war economic boom transformed Umbria Centrale, with tourism becoming a major industry after UNESCO designation for Assisi in 2000 <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>.

The Umbri introduced advanced agriculture, while Romans built theaters in Spello.<sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup> The medieval period saw Foligno as a printing center, producing Italy’s first printed book in 1472.<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup> The Franciscan movement in Assisi fostered humanism, with San Francesco’s teachings spreading globally. The 18th-century papal rule brought land reforms, improving yields near San Venanzo. The 19th-century unification introduced infrastructure like the Foligno-Terni railway.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century saw Umbria Centrale’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans using the hills around Capodacqua for guerrilla warfare. The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Foligno, while rural areas like Ficulle focused on olive oil. Recent preservation efforts, like the Valnerina landscape management, highlight ecological history <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. Umbria Centrale’s history, marked by spiritual depth and cultural preservation, continues to define its identity.</p>
