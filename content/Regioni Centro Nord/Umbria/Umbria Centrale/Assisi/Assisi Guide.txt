<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Assisi’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic hilltop position in Umbria. Founded by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, it was later settled by the Etruscans, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near Monte Subasio evidencing early settlement. Under Roman rule, as *Asisium*, the town thrived along the Via Flaminia, with the Temple of Minerva (1st century BC) as a civic center, now part of Piazza del Comune <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with Saint Rufino’s martyrdom marking Assisi’s religious significance. In the 12th century, the births of Saint Francis (1181/82) and Saint Clare (1194) transformed Assisi into a spiritual hub. The Basilica di San Francesco, begun in 1228, was built to honor Francis, attracting pilgrims and artists like Giotto <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 12th century saw Assisi as a free commune, aligning with Perugia against regional powers, with the Rocca Maggiore fortified to protect against conflicts like the <strong>Battle of Collestrada</strong> (1202) <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages brought prosperity, with Assisi’s religious significance drawing papal patronage. The 14th century saw the construction of the Basilica di Santa Chiara and Cattedrale di San Rufino, reinforcing its pilgrimage status. In the 15th century, Assisi fell under the Papal States, with Renaissance frescoes enhancing its churches <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Assisi join unified Italy in 1860, with its religious sites gaining global recognition.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with a 1997 earthquake damaging the Basilica di San Francesco’s frescoes, restored by 1999. World War II spared Assisi major damage, as it was declared a hospital city. The Basilica’s UNESCO designation in 2000 and Via di Francesco promotion have boosted tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Foro Romano have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Diocesano, reinforcing Assisi’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to spiritual capital, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
