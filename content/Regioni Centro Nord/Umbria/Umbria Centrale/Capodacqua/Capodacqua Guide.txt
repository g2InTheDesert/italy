<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Capodacqua’s history is a quiet narrative of medieval origins, agricultural resilience, and regional significance, shaped by its position in the Topino Valley. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Topino River evidencing early settlement. The name Capodacqua, meaning “head of the water,” reflects its proximity to springs and rivers <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Capodacqua, part of *Fulginium* (modern Foligno), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting nearby markets. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di Santa Maria in Campis established as a parish in the 13th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Capodacqua was under Foligno’s control, a fortified commune aligned with Perugia. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought nearby, saw Foligno’s forces support Perugia against Assisi, with Capodacqua contributing resources <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Capodacqua develop as an agricultural center, with its olive oil and wine production supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with Foligno’s Palazzo dei Trinci serving as a regional hub. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with the Chiesa di San Francesco in Foligno reflecting the area’s growth <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Capodacqua join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to Santa Maria in Campis, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Capodacqua major damage, with partisan activity in the Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including olive oil and wine routes, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Topino have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in Foligno’s Museo della Stampa, reinforcing Capodacqua’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to agricultural hamlet, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
