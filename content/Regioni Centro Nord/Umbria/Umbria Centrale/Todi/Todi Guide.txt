<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Todi’s history spans over 2,700 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins as one of Umbria’s oldest cities. Founded around the 8th century BC by the Etruscans, Todi (known as *Tuder*) was a fortified hilltop settlement, with archaeological finds like cinerary urns and bronze tools near the Tiber River evidencing its prosperity. The Etruscan walls, partially preserved, are among Umbria’s oldest <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Todi, renamed *Tuder*, thrived as a colony along the Via Flaminia, with a forum, amphitheater, and baths. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with Saint Fortunatus’s martyrdom marking Todi’s religious significance. In the 12th century, Todi became a free commune, fortifying its medieval walls against regional conflicts. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 30 kilometers away, saw Todi support Perugia against Assisi <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Todi flourish as a trade and agricultural center, with the Piazza del Popolo developed as a civic hub. In the 13th century, the Palazzo del Popolo and Cattedrale di Santa Maria Annunziata were built, reflecting communal pride. In the 14th century, Todi fell under the Papal States, with the Palazzo dei Priori serving as a governance center <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with the Tempio di Santa Maria della Consolazione showcasing architectural innovation <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Todi join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to the Cattedrale, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Todi major damage, with partisan activity in the nearby Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including Etruscan site promotion and the Todi Festival, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Tiber have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo-Pinacoteca, reinforcing Todi’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan stronghold to medieval city, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
