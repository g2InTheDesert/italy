<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Marsciano’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Nestore Valley. Founded by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Tiber River evidencing early settlement. The name Marsciano, possibly from the Latin *Marcius*, reflects a Roman family or landowner <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Marsciano, known as *Marcianum*, thrived along the Via Flaminia, with kilns producing bricks for regional construction. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Giovanni Battista established as a parish <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Marsciano became a free commune under Perugia, fortifying its defenses with the Palazzo Pietromarchi. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought nearby, saw Marsciano support Perugia against Assisi <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Marsciano flourish as a brick-making center, with its kilns supplying materials for Umbrian churches and palaces. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the Palazzo Comunale built as a civic hub. The Renaissance brought prosperity, with the Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta in Spina reflecting the town’s growth <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Marsciano join unified Italy in 1860, with its brick industry peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and industrial decline. World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting nearby rail lines. Post-war restoration preserved the medieval core, and tourism initiatives, including the Museo del Laterizio, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Nestore have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo del Laterizio, reinforcing Marsciano’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to industrial hub, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
