<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Colfiorito’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its highland position in the Apennine foothills. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Colfiorito marshes evidencing early settlement. The name Colfiorito, possibly from Latin *Collis Floritus* (flowering hill), reflects its fertile plateau <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Colfiorito, part of *Plestia* (near modern Colfiorito), thrived as an agricultural and trade outpost, with the Via Flaminia facilitating connections to Foligno and Rome. The Roman settlement of Plestia, with ruins near the Chiesa di Santa Maria di Plestia, included a forum and baths <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta established as a parish in the 14th century. In the 12th century, Colfiorito was under Foligno’s control, a fortified commune aligned with Perugia. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 20 kilometers away, saw Foligno’s forces support Perugia against Assisi, with Colfiorito contributing resources <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Colfiorito develop as an agricultural center, with its lentils and spelt supplying Umbrian markets. The Castello di Colfiorito, built in the 13th century, protected the plateau against regional conflicts. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with Foligno’s Palazzo dei Trinci serving as a regional hub <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes added to local churches. The 19th century saw Colfiorito join unified Italy in 1860, with its lentil production gaining regional fame.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to Santa Maria Assunta, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Colfiorito major damage, with partisan activity in the Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Parco Regionale di Colfiorito and lentil festivals, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near Plestia have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the park’s museum, reinforcing Colfiorito’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to agricultural hamlet, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
