<p>Colfiorito, a highland village in Umbria’s Foligno district, sits at 760 meters, known for its red potatoes and lentil fields. Its medieval origins are evident in the Rocca di Colfiorito, a ruined castle, and the nearby Palude di Colfiorito, a marshland nature reserve for birdwatching. A hub for hearty cuisine like lentil soups and porchetta, Colfiorito’s mountain air and Apennine views attract hikers. Its serene setting near the Marche border makes it a rustic Umbrian escape.</p>
