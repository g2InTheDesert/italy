<p>Umbria Centrale, the spiritual and cultural heart of Italy’s “green heart,” is anchored by Assisi, birthplace of St. Francis, with its awe-inspiring basilica. Foligno, a bustling market town, and Spello, with its flower-decked alleys, exude medieval charm. Todi’s hilltop elegance and Bettona’s Etruscan roots add historical depth, while smaller villages like Capodacqua and Valtopina offer rural tranquility. Known for truffles, olive oil, and festivals, Umbria Centrale is a serene destination for pilgrims, foodies, and history enthusiasts.</p>
