<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Foligno’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its strategic position in the Topino Valley. Founded by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, Foligno (known as *Fulginia*) was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Topino River evidencing early settlement. Under Roman rule, Foligno, renamed *Fulginium*, thrived as a colony along the Via Flaminia, with a forum, amphitheater, and baths. The Roman bridge over the Topino, partially preserved, facilitated trade with Rome <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with Saint Felician’s martyrdom marking Foligno’s religious significance. In the 12th century, Foligno became a free commune, aligning with Perugia against regional powers. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202) saw Foligno defeat Assisi, reinforcing its dominance <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 13th century brought prosperity, with the Cattedrale di San Feliciano and Palazzo Trinci built as civic and religious hubs. Foligno’s printing industry emerged in the 15th century, with the first Italian edition of Dante’s *Divine Comedy* printed in 1472 <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Foligno under the Trinci family’s rule, followed by the Papal States in the 15th century. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with frescoes by Gentile da Fabriano adorning Palazzo Trinci. The 19th century saw Foligno join unified Italy in 1860, with its textile and agricultural economies peaking <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 20th century brought challenges, with the 1997 Umbria earthquake damaging Palazzo Trinci, repaired by 2000. World War II caused minor damage, with Allied bombings targeting rail lines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Giostra della Quintana and museum development, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Topino have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Foligno’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to cultural hub, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
