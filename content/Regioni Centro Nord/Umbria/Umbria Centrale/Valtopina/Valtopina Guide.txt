<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Valtopina’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Topino Valley. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Topino River evidencing early settlement. The name Valtopina, possibly from *vallis Topina* (Topino Valley), reflects its geographic setting <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Valtopina, part of *Fulginium* (modern Foligno), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting nearby markets. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Bernardino established as a parish in the 14th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Valtopina was a fortified commune under Foligno’s influence, with the Castello di Valtopina built to protect against regional conflicts. The <strong>Battle of Pian del Carpine</strong> (1202), fought 15 kilometers away, saw Foligno’s forces, including Valtopina, defeat Assisi, reinforcing regional dominance <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Valtopina develop as an agricultural and textile center, with its truffles and spelt supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the Palazzo Comunale serving as a civic hub <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes added to local churches. The 19th century saw Valtopina join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional crafts. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to San Bernardino, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Valtopina major damage, with partisan activity in the Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Mostra Mercato del Tartufo and textile museum, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Topino River have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in Foligno’s Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Valtopina’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to truffle hub, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
