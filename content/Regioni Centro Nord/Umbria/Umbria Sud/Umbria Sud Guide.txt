    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Umbria Sud’s history is a saga of ancient tribes, spiritual revolutions, and rural resilience, beginning with Umbri settlements around 1000 BC. The Umbri, an Italic tribe, established hilltop towns like Orvieto and Amelia, influencing Roman culture with their religious practices.<sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup> Rome conquered Umbria by the 3rd century BC, transforming it into a prosperous region with roads like the Via Flaminia and villas near Narni.<sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup></p>

    <p>The fall of Rome in 476 AD led to Lombard rule, who fortified villages like Spoleto.<sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup> The Middle Ages saw the rise of communes, with Spoleto as a duchy under the Lombards, and the 11th-century conflicts shaping regional politics. The 6th century brought the Benedictine movement, with San Benedetto founding his order in Norcia, revolutionizing monasticism.<sup><a href="#cite-28">28</a></sup> The Papal States controlled Umbria from the 16th century, with reforms in the 18th century improving agriculture in Acquasparta.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup></p>

    <p>The Risorgimento led to unification in 1860, with Umbria joining the Kingdom of Italy after Orvieto’s uprising.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century brought industrialization in Terni (near Narni), but rural areas like Alviano remained agricultural. The 1997 earthquake damaged Norcia’s basilica, restored by 2000, and the 2016 earthquake heavily impacted Norcia, prompting ongoing reconstruction <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Post-war economic boom transformed Umbria Sud, with tourism becoming a major industry after UNESCO designation for Orvieto’s Duomo in 2000 <sup><a href="#cite-12">12</a></sup>. Today, Umbria Sud balances its ancient legacy with modern development, from UNESCO sites to sustainable agriculture. Its history, from Umbri tribes to monastic cradle, underscores its enduring cultural impact.</p>

    <p>Umbria Sud’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a cultural crossroads. The Umbri introduced advanced agriculture, while Romans built amphitheaters in Amelia.<sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup> The medieval period saw Spoleto as a cultural hub, hosting emperors like Frederick Barbarossa. The Benedictine movement in Norcia fostered monasticism, with San Benedetto’s Rule influencing European spirituality.<sup><a href="#cite-28">28</a></sup> The 18th-century papal rule brought land reforms, improving yields near Lugano in Teverina. The 19th-century unification introduced infrastructure like the Orvieto-Terni railway.<sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup> The 20th century saw Umbria Sud’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans using the hills around Narni for guerrilla warfare. The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Terni, while rural areas like Alviano focused on olive oil. Recent preservation efforts, like the Valnerina landscape management in Norcia, highlight ecological history <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. Umbria Sud’s history, marked by spiritual depth and cultural preservation, continues to define its identity.</p>

    <p>The region’s historical significance extends to its role in art, with Orvieto’s Duomo influencing Renaissance fresco techniques.
