<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Alviano’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Tiber Valley. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Tiber River evidencing early settlement. The name Alviano, possibly derived from the Latin *Albianum* (linked to a Roman family), reflects its ancient origins <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Alviano, part of the *Tuder* region (modern Todi), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting nearby markets. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta established as a parish in the 13th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Alviano was a fortified commune under Orvieto’s influence, with the Castello di Alviano built in the 15th century by Bartolomeo d’Alviano, a condottiero, to protect against regional conflicts <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Alviano flourish as an agricultural center, with its wine and olive oil production supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the castle serving as a military stronghold <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes added to local churches. The 19th century saw Alviano join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to the Castello and Santa Maria Assunta, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Alviano major damage, with partisan activity in the Tiber Valley. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the WWF Alviano Oasis and local festivals, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Tiber have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo della Civiltà Contadina, reinforcing Alviano’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to medieval stronghold, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
