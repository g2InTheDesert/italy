<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Amelia’s history spans over 3,000 years, rooted in its pre-Etruscan origins as one of Umbria’s oldest settlements. Founded around the 10th century BC by the Umbrians, Amelia (known as *Ameria*) was a fortified hilltop city, with the Mura Poligonali evidencing its early prosperity. Etruscan influence followed in the 6th century BC, with archaeological finds like pottery, cinerary urns, and tombs near the Tiber River highlighting its role as a trade hub. The bronze statue of Germanicus, discovered near Amelia, underscores its cultural significance during this period <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Amelia became a municipium in the 4th century BC, thriving along the Via Amerina, a key trade route connecting to Rome. The Roman cisterns beneath Piazza Matteotti, still accessible, provided water to the city, reflecting its advanced infrastructure. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with Saint Fermina’s martyrdom establishing the Cattedrale di Santa Fermina as a religious center. In the 12th century, Amelia became a free commune, aligning with the Papal States against regional rivals, fortifying its walls to protect against invasions <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Amelia flourish as an agricultural and trade center, with its wine and olive oil supplying Umbrian markets. The 13th century brought the construction of the Cattedrale and Palazzo Boccarini, symbolizing civic pride. In the 14th century, Amelia fell under the Papal States, with its strategic position making it a key stronghold. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes by the Umbrian school adorning local churches. The 19th century saw Amelia join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking, particularly in olive oil and wine production <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to the Cattedrale and Palazzo Boccarini, with repairs completed by 2000. World War II spared Amelia major damage, though partisan activity in the Tiber Valley was significant. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Museo Archeologico and festivals like the Palio dei Colombi, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological excavations near the Roman cisterns and Necropoli di San Damiano have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Amelia’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from pre-Etruscan stronghold to medieval town, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Amelia’s historical narrative is further enriched by its role in regional politics. During the Middle Ages, the town was a battleground for control between noble families and the Papal States, with the Mura Poligonali serving as a defensive bulwark. The 16th century saw Amelia under the influence of the Farnese family, who left architectural marks like the Palazzo Farrattini, now a private residence but occasionally open for guided tours (€6) <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The town’s integration into unified Italy marked a shift toward modernization, with the establishment of the Teatro Sociale in 1886, which became a cultural hub for the community. Amelia’s resilience through earthquakes and wars, combined with its preservation of ancient structures, makes it a living testament to Umbria’s layered history.</p>
