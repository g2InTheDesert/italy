<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Orvieto’s history spans over 3,000 years, rooted in its Etruscan origins as one of Umbria’s oldest settlements. Founded around the 9th century BC by the Etruscans, Orvieto (known as *Volsinii Veteres*) was a major city, with archaeological finds like necropolises and the Crocifisso del Tufo evidencing its prosperity. Its volcanic tuff cliff provided natural defense <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Orvieto was sacked in 264 BC and refounded as *Volsinii Novae*, thriving along the Via Flaminia. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Duomo’s origins tied to the 1290 Miracle of Bolsena, prompting its construction. In the 12th century, Orvieto became a free commune, aligning with the Guelphs against Ghibelline rivals. The 13th century saw the Duomo’s foundation, symbolizing civic and religious pride <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 14th century, Orvieto fell under the Papal States, serving as a papal refuge, with the Pozzo di San Patrizio built to ensure water supply <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with Signorelli’s frescoes elevating Orvieto’s artistic profile. The 19th century saw Orvieto join unified Italy in 1860, with its wine industry peaking <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 20th century brought challenges, with the 1997 Umbria earthquake causing minor damage to the Duomo, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Orvieto major damage, with partisan activity in the Paglia Valley. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Umbria Jazz Winter Festival and Etruscan site promotion, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the necropolis have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Museo Claudio Faina, reinforcing Orvieto’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan stronghold to medieval papal city, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
