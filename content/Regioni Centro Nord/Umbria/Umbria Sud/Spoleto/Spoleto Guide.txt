    <p>Russi’s cultural landscape is a serene blend of medieval heritage, rural traditions, and culinary excellence, reflecting its role as a tranquil village in Umbria. The <strong>Chiesa di San Martino</strong>, a 13th-century Romanesque church in the village center, is the cultural cornerstone.

Entry is free, with donations welcomed, and guided tours can be arranged through the Spoleto tourist office for €5 <sup><a href="#cite-1">1</a></sup>.</p>

Guided hikes cost €8 <sup><a href="#cite-2">2</a></sup>. Russi’s artisans, producing ceramics, terracotta, and woven textiles, sell their wares at the Sagra del Tartufo e del Vino and regional markets in Spoleto.

<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Russi’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Topino Valley. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Topino River evidencing early settlement. The name Russi, possibly derived from a local landowner or a corruption of *russus* (red, referring to the soil), reflects its rural setting <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Russi, part of *Spoletium* (modern Spoleto), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with olive groves and vineyards supporting nearby markets. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di San Martino established as a parish in the 13th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Russi was under Spoleto’s control, a powerful commune aligned with the Papal States. The <strong>Battle of Spoletium</strong> (217 BC), fought near Spoleto, saw Hannibal’s forces besiege the region, with Russi contributing resources <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Russi develop as an agricultural center, with its truffles and wine supplying Umbrian markets. The Castello di Russi, built in the 12th century, protected the valley against conflicts. In the 14th century, Russi fell under the Papal States, with Spoleto’s Rocca Albornoziana serving as a regional hub <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes added to local churches. The 19th century saw Russi join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to San Martino, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Russi major damage, with partisan activity in the nearby Apennines. Post-war tourism initiatives, including local festivals and proximity to Spoleto’s attractions, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Topino have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in Spoleto’s Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Russi’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to rural hamlet, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Cultural events shape daily life, with the Festa di San Martino and Sagra del Tartufo e del Vino uniting residents and tourists.
