<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Acquasparta’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position in the Tiber Valley. Likely settled by the Umbrians around the 8th century BC, the area was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs near the Naia River evidencing early settlement. The name Acquasparta, derived from *aqua sparsa* (scattered waters), reflects its mineral springs <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule, Acquasparta, part of the *Tuder* region (modern Todi), thrived as an agricultural outpost, with its springs used for therapeutic purposes. By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Chiesa di Santa Cecilia established as a parish in the 14th century <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. In the 12th century, Acquasparta was a fortified commune under Spoleto’s influence, with the Palazzo Cesi built in the 16th century by the Cesi family, marking a Renaissance peak <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Acquasparta flourish as an agricultural and spa center, with its wine and olive oil supplying Umbrian markets. In the 14th century, it fell under the Papal States, with the palace serving as a cultural hub <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 19th century saw Acquasparta join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking. The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to Santa Cecilia, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Acquasparta major damage, with partisan activity in the Tiber Valley. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Palazzo Cesi and local festivals, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Naia have uncovered Etruscan artifacts, displayed in the Museo della Civiltà Contadina, reinforcing Acquasparta’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to Renaissance town, underscores its enduring significance.</p>
