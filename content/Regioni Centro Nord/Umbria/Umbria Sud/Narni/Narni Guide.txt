<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Narni’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its strategic position in the Nera Valley. Founded by the Umbrians around the 6th century BC, Narni (known as *Nequinum*) was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs evidencing early settlement. Under Roman rule, Narni, renamed *Narnia*, became a colony in 299 BC, thriving along the Via Flaminia with structures like the Ponte d’Augusto and Roman cisterns <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 4th century, Christianity spread, with Saint Juvenal’s martyrdom establishing the Cattedrale di San Giovenale. In the 12th century, Narni became a free commune, aligning with the Papal States against regional rivals. The 13th century saw the construction of the Rocca Albornoziana, symbolizing papal control <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Middle Ages saw Narni flourish as a trade and agricultural center, with its wine and olive oil supplying Umbrian markets. The 14th century brought the Palazzo Eroli, a civic hub <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with frescoes by the Umbrian school adorning local churches. The 19th century saw Narni join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 20th century brought challenges, with the 1997 Umbria earthquake damaging the Cattedrale and Rocca, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Narni major damage, with partisan activity in the Nera Valley. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Corsa all’Anello and Narni Sotterranea, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Ponte d’Augusto have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo della Città, reinforcing Narni’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Umbrian settlement to medieval stronghold, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Narni’s historical narrative is further enriched by its role as a papal stronghold. The Rocca Albornoziana served as a defensive fortress and administrative center, while the underground chambers of Narni Sotterranea reveal a darker history, including an Inquisition trial room used in the 16th century. The town’s strategic position along the Via Flaminia made it a key stop for travelers and merchants, contributing to its economic and cultural prominence. Narni’s preservation of Roman and medieval structures, combined with its modern tourism initiatives, makes it a living testament to Umbria’s layered history.</p>
