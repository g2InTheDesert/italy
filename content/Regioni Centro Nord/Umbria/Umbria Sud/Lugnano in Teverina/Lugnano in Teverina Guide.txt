<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Lugnano in Teverina’s history spans over two millennia, rooted in its strategic position overlooking the Tiber Valley. Founded around the 6th century BC by the Umbrians, Lugnano (possibly derived from *Lucus Jani*, a wood dedicated to Janus) was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs evidencing early settlement. The Roman villa at Poggio Gramignano, built in the 1st century BC, highlights its prosperity under Roman rule, with its luxurious design and farm-estate <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity spread, with the Collegiate Church of Santa Maria Assunta established as a parish in the 12th century. Saint Francis’s visit in 1212, marked by a miracle involving a duck and a wolf, led to the construction of the Church and Convent of San Francesco in 1229 <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>. In the Middle Ages, Lugnano was under Orvieto’s control, later becoming a possession of Rome and the Farnese family, who held the title of perpetual governors until the 18th century. The Palazzo Pennone served as a residence for the Vannicelli family and papal legates <sup><a href="#cite-15">15</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 12th century saw Lugnano fortify its medieval walls, rebuilt by Pope Pius II in the 15th century, to protect against regional conflicts. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with the Palazzo Pennone reflecting architectural advancements. The 19th century saw Lugnano join unified Italy in 1860, with its agricultural economy peaking in olive oil and wine production <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>. The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and the decline of traditional farming. The 1997 Umbria earthquake caused minor damage to the Collegiate Church, repaired by 2000. World War II spared Lugnano major damage, with partisan activity in the Tiber Valley. Post-war tourism initiatives, including its “Borgo più bello” designation and festivals like the Palio dell’Assunta, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Recent archaeological excavations at Poggio Gramignano have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico in Amelia, reinforcing Lugnano’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. The discovery of a children’s cemetery at Poggio Gramignano, including a “vampire” burial with a stone in the mouth, has drawn international attention, highlighting the site’s archaeological significance <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>. Lugnano’s history, from Umbrian settlement to medieval village, underscores its enduring cultural and historical importance.</p>
