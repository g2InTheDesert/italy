<p>Lugano in Teverina, a tiny Umbrian hamlet near Alviano, is a peaceful retreat in the Tiber Valley. Its medieval stone houses and small Chiesa di San Michele reflect rural simplicity, while the surrounding vineyards produce Grechetto wines. A stop for agriturismo, Lugano offers farm stays with homemade pasta and olive oil tastings. Its proximity to Orvieto and Civita di Bagnoregio makes it an ideal base for exploring southern Umbriaâ€™s treasures in a tranquil, unspoiled setting.</p>
