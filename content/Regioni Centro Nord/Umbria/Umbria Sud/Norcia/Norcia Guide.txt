<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Norcia’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its strategic position in the Sibillini Mountains. Founded by the Sabines around the 5th century BC, Norcia (known as *Nursia*) was a trade hub, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs evidencing early settlement. Under Roman rule, Norcia thrived as a municipium, with the Via Flaminia facilitating trade. The birthplace of Saint Benedict and his twin sister Saint Scholastica in 480 AD, Norcia became a spiritual center <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 5th century, Christianity solidified, with the Basilica di San Benedetto established over Benedict’s birthplace. In the 12th century, Norcia became a free commune, aligning with the Papal States against regional rivals. The 13th century saw the construction of the Castellina fortress, symbolizing civic and papal authority <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Middle Ages saw Norcia flourish as an agricultural and butchery center, with “norcineria” techniques for cured meats gaining fame across Italy <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with frescoes by the Umbrian school adorning churches. The 19th century saw Norcia join unified Italy in 1860, with its gastronomic economy peaking <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 20th century brought challenges, with earthquakes in 1979 and 2016 damaging landmarks like the Basilica and Castellina. Reconstruction efforts continue, supported by national and international aid. World War II spared Norcia major damage, with partisan activity in the Sibillini Mountains. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Mostra Mercato del Tartufo Nero and Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibillini, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Roman forum have uncovered artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico, reinforcing Norcia’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from Sabine settlement to gastronomic capital, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Norcia’s historical narrative is further enriched by its role as a spiritual and economic center. The Benedictine monastic tradition, established by Saint Benedict, spread across Europe, with Norcia remaining a pilgrimage site. The town’s norcineria tradition, dating back to the Middle Ages, made it a hub for artisanal butchery, with techniques still practiced today. The 2016 earthquake, while devastating, sparked a global solidarity movement, with cultural events like the <strong>Fior di Cacio</strong> cheese festival supporting recovery efforts <sup><a href="#cite-4">4</a></sup>. Norcia’s resilience and preservation of its heritage make it a living testament to Umbria’s history.</p>
