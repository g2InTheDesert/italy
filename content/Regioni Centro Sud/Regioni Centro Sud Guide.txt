<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Regioni Centro Sud’s history is a saga of ancient civilizations, conquests, and cultural fusion, beginning with prehistoric settlements around 6000 BC in Campania. Greek colonists founded Cumae in Campania (8th century BC), spreading Hellenic culture, while Molise was inhabited by Samnites. Rome conquered the area by the 3rd century BC, transforming Campania into a resort for elites with villas in Baiae, and Molise as a granary.</p>

    <p>The Roman era saw prosperity, but Vesuvius' eruption in 79 AD buried Pompeii in Campania. The empire’s fall in 476 AD led to Ostrogoth and Byzantine rule, with Campania fortified and Molise under Lombard control. Arabs raided Campania in the 9th century, introducing crops, while Normans united the south in the 11th century, creating the Kingdom of Sicily.</p>

    <p>The Angevin dynasty shifted the capital to Naples in the 13th century, fostering Gothic architecture. The Aragonese brought Renaissance influences, with Spanish rule following. The Bourbon era (18th–19th centuries) saw Naples as a European capital. The Risorgimento led to unification in 1860, with Garibaldi’s campaign in Campania. The 20th century brought industrialization in Naples, but challenges like the 1906 Vesuvius eruption and WWII landings in Salerno. Post-war economic boom transformed the region, though issues like the Camorra in Campania and emigration in Molise persist. The 1980 Irpinia earthquake killed thousands in Campania, prompting reconstruction. Today, Regioni Centro Sud balances its ancient legacy with modern development, from UNESCO sites to high-speed rail. Its history, from Greek colonies to unified Italy, underscores its enduring cultural impact.</p>

    <p>Regioni Centro Sud’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a cultural crossroads. The Greeks introduced philosophy in Neapolis, while Romans built amphitheaters in Capua. The medieval period saw the Amalfi Republic in Campania influencing navigation. The Renaissance in Naples fostered artists like Caravaggio. The Bourbon period saw the excavation of Pompeii. The 19th-century unification brought infrastructure like the Naples-Portici railway. The 20th century saw the region’s involvement in the Resistance, with partisans in Molise’s mountains. The post-war "economic miracle" brought factories to Campania, while rural Molise focused on agriculture. Recent preservation efforts, like the Gran Sasso Park in Abruzzo (bordering Molise), highlight ecological history. Regioni Centro Sud’s history, marked by conquest and innovation, continues to define its identity.</p>

    <p>The region’s historical significance extends to its role in religion, with San Benedetto’s birth in Norcia (Umbria, but influential in Molise). The 2016 earthquake prompted community rebuilding in Norcia. Regioni Centro Sud’s history, blending imperial glory and spiritual depth, offers a living testament to its layered past.</p>
