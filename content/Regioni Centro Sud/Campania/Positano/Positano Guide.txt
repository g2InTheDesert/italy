<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Positano’s history spans over 2,000 years, rooted in its maritime and mythological origins. Legend attributes its founding to the Greek god Poseidon, with archaeological evidence suggesting settlement by the Greeks in the 6th century BC. Under Roman rule, Positano (named *Posides* or *Paestum*) thrived as a resort for elites, with villas like the Villa Romana showcasing opulent frescoes <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 9th century, Positano emerged as a key port of the Amalfi Maritime Republic, facilitating trade with the Byzantine Empire and Islamic world. Its shipyards produced vessels for commerce and defense, contributing to the republic’s wealth. The 11th century saw the construction of the Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta, reflecting Positano’s growing religious and civic pride. Norman conquests in the 12th century diminished Amalfi’s power, but Positano retained its maritime significance <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 1343 tsunami damaged the coast, shifting the economy toward fishing and agriculture.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Positano develop as a fishing village, with defensive towers built to protect against Saracen pirates, many still visible along the coast. The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes adorning churches. The 19th century saw Positano join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on fishing, lemon groves, and early tourism <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The 20th century marked a cultural renaissance, with Positano attracting artists, writers, and celebrities, spurred by John Steinbeck’s 1953 essay in *Harper’s Bazaar*. The 1997 UNESCO World Heritage designation for the Amalfi Coast boosted tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological excavations near the Villa Romana have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the MAR, reinforcing Positano’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Roman resort to artistic haven, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Positano’s historical narrative is further enriched by its maritime and cultural exchanges. The Byzantine Black Madonna icon, likely brought by traders, symbolizes Positano’s medieval connections to the East. The 16th century saw Spanish rule, with the construction of watchtowers like Torre Trasita, now a private residence but visible from coastal trails <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. The post-World War II tourism boom transformed Positano into a global destination, with its cliffside architecture inspiring films and literature. Positano’s preservation of its medieval and Roman heritage, combined with its modern allure, makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>

The Positano bus station in Piazza dei Mulini is central, with ferries docking at the Spiaggia Grande marina <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Driving via the A3 motorway to Vietri sul Mare, then SS163 (Amalfi Coast road), takes 1.5 hours from Naples, with limited parking near Piazza Flavio Gioia (€4/hour due to scarce space) <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.
