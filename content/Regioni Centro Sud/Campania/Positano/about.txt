<p>Positano, a postcard-perfect village cascading down cliffs to the Amalfi Coast’s shimmering waters, is synonymous with Mediterranean glamour. Its pastel-colored houses, draped in bougainvillea, create a stunning vertical mosaic, best admired from the sea. The Spiaggia Grande beach buzzes with activity, while boutiques along steep alleys sell handmade sandals and linen. The Church of Santa Maria Assunta, with its majolica-tiled dome, adds historic charm. Positano’s allure lies in its blend of luxury, natural beauty, and serene coastal vibes, drawing romantics and jet-setters alike.</p>
