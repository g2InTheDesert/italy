<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Castellabate’s history spans over 1,000 years, rooted in its strategic position along the Cilento coast. Founded in 1123 by Abbot Costabile Gentilcore, who built the Castello dell’Abate to protect against Saracen raids, Castellabate (named *Castrum Abbatis*, Castle of the Abbot) emerged as a feudal stronghold under the Sanseverino family. Archaeological evidence suggests earlier Greek and Roman settlements, with finds like pottery near the coast <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 12th century, Castellabate was a key port in the Duchy of Naples, facilitating trade with the Byzantine Empire. The Chiesa di Santa Maria de Gulia, built in the 13th century, reflected the village’s growing religious significance. The Middle Ages saw Castellabate flourish as a fishing and agricultural center, with olive groves and vineyards supporting the economy <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The 16th century brought Spanish rule, with coastal watchtowers like Torre Perrotti constructed to defend against Ottoman pirates <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes adorning churches. The 19th century saw Castellabate join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on fishing, olive oil, and early tourism. The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and economic decline, but post-war tourism initiatives, including UNESCO designation in 1998 for the Cilento Park, revitalized the town <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. The 1980 Irpinia earthquake caused minor damage to the castle, repaired by 1990. Recent archaeological digs near San Marco have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo del Mare, reinforcing Castellabate’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from medieval stronghold to coastal retreat, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Castellabate’s historical narrative is further enriched by its feudal and maritime legacy. The Sanseverino family, who controlled the village until the 18th century, left architectural marks like Palazzo Granito, now a cultural venue. The 17th century saw the construction of defensive towers along the coast, many converted into private residences but visible from beaches like Punta Licosa <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. The 20th century tourism boom, spurred by *Benvenuti al Sud*, transformed Castellabate into a global destination. Its preservation of medieval structures and coastal heritage makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>
