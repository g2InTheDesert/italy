<p>Salerno, a vibrant port city at the Amalfi Coast’s edge, blends historic grandeur with modern energy. Its medieval Centro Storico, with narrow lanes and the imposing Duomo di San Matteo, housing the saint’s relics, reflects its Norman past. The Lungomare Trieste, a palm-lined promenade, offers stunning Gulf of Salerno views, while the Castello di Arechi looms above, guarding the city. Known for its medical school, one of Europe’s oldest, and lively culinary scene featuring fresh seafood and mozzarella, Salerno is a dynamic gateway to the Amalfi region.</p>
