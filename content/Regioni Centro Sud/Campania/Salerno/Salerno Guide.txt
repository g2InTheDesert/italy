<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Salerno’s history spans over 2,500 years, rooted in its strategic position along the Tyrrhenian Sea. Founded by the Etruscans around the 6th century BC, Salerno (known as *Salernum*) became a Roman colony in 197 BC, thriving along the Via Popilia with structures like the Roman bridge and forum. By the 6th century, Salerno was a key Lombard duchy, with the Castello di Arechi built as a defensive stronghold <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>In the 9th century, Salerno rose to prominence as the seat of the <strong>Schola Medica Salernitana</strong>, Europe’s first medical school, attracting scholars from across the Mediterranean. The 11th century saw the construction of the Duomo di San Matteo, reflecting Norman influence after their conquest in 1076. Salerno served as the capital of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily until 1127 <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Middle Ages saw Salerno flourish as a maritime and intellectual center, with the medical school producing texts like the *Regimen Sanitatis Salernitanum* <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with Baroque additions to churches like San Giorgio. The 19th century saw Salerno join unified Italy in 1860, with its port becoming a key economic driver. The 20th century brought challenges, with World War II Allied landings in 1943 causing damage, followed by reconstruction. The 1980 Irpinia earthquake affected the historic center, with repairs completed by 1990. Post-war tourism initiatives, including Luci d’Artista and the Salerno Festival, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Roman forum have uncovered Etruscan and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Salerno’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Etruscan settlement to medical pioneer, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Salerno’s historical narrative is further enriched by its role as a cultural crossroads. The Schola Medica Salernitana fostered exchanges between Christian, Islamic, and Jewish scholars, shaping medieval medicine. The city’s port facilitated trade with the Byzantine Empire and North Africa, leaving Arab-Norman architectural influences in the Duomo’s courtyard. The 17th century saw Spanish rule, with fortifications like the Lungomare’s bastions. Salerno’s resilience through wars and earthquakes, combined with its preservation of medieval structures, makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>
