<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Amalfi’s history spans over 1,500 years, rooted in its role as a maritime power. Founded around the 4th century AD by Roman refugees, Amalfi (named after a mythical nymph) became a powerful maritime republic by the 9th century. As one of the four Italian Maritime Republics, alongside Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, Amalfi dominated Mediterranean trade, establishing colonies in the Byzantine Empire and North Africa. The <strong>Tavole Amalfitane</strong>, a maritime code, influenced international law <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 10th century, Amalfi’s wealth funded the construction of the Duomo di Sant’Andrea, reflecting its religious and civic pride. The 11th century saw Amalfi’s peak, with the Arsenale producing ships for trade and defense. However, Norman conquests in the 12th century diminished its power, and Amalfi fell under the Kingdom of Sicily. The 1343 tsunami devastated the coast, destroying much of its port <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Middle Ages saw Amalfi thrive as a paper-making center, with mills in the Valle dei Mulini producing high-quality paper exported across Europe <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with frescoes and sculptures adorning churches. The 19th century saw Amalfi join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy shifting to fishing and agriculture. The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration and economic decline, but post-war tourism initiatives, including UNESCO designation in 1997, revitalized the town <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. The 1953 earthquake caused minor damage to the Duomo, repaired by 1960. Recent archaeological digs near the Arsenale have uncovered Byzantine artifacts, displayed in the Arsenale museum, reinforcing Amalfi’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-9">9</a></sup>. Its history, from maritime republic to coastal gem, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Amalfi’s historical narrative is further enriched by its role in medieval trade and culture. The town’s merchants introduced the compass and nautical charts to Europe, revolutionizing navigation. The <strong>Chiostro del Paradiso</strong>, built in the 13th century, reflects Arab-Norman influences, showcasing Amalfi’s cultural exchanges with the Islamic world <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. The 17th century saw Amalfi under Spanish rule, with the construction of defensive towers along the coast to protect against pirates. Amalfi’s resilience through natural disasters and economic shifts, combined with its preservation of medieval structures, makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>
