<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Praiano’s history spans over 1,500 years, rooted in its maritime and religious origins. Likely settled by Greek and Roman fishermen around the 4th century AD, Praiano (possibly derived from *Pelagianum*, meaning open sea) became a small port under the Amalfi Maritime Republic by the 9th century. Its strategic position facilitated trade with the Byzantine Empire, with the Chiesa di San Gennaro built in the 13th century as a religious center <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 12th century, Praiano was a key fishing village within the Amalfi Republic, with watchtowers like Torre a Mare constructed to defend against Saracen pirates. The 1343 tsunami damaged the coast, shifting the economy toward agriculture, particularly lemon groves <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Middle Ages saw Praiano flourish as a fishing and textile center, with silk production noted in historical records <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with frescoes adorning churches like San Luca Evangelista.</p>

    <p>The 19th century saw Praiano join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on fishing, lemon farming, and early tourism. The 20th century marked a tourism boom, with Praiano’s serene beauty attracting visitors seeking a quieter alternative to Amalfi. The 1997 UNESCO World Heritage designation for the Amalfi Coast boosted tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. The 1953 earthquake caused minor damage to churches, repaired by 1960. Recent archaeological digs near Marina di Praia have uncovered Roman fishing tools, displayed in the Centro Culturale, reinforcing Praiano’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from maritime village to coastal retreat, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Praiano’s historical narrative is further enriched by its maritime and cultural exchanges. The Arab-Norman influences in its churches reflect medieval trade with the Islamic world. The 16th century saw Spanish rule, with additional watchtowers built along the coast. The 19th-century Grand Tour brought European travelers, cementing Praiano’s reputation as a tranquil haven. Praiano’s preservation of its medieval churches and towers makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>

    <p>Praiano is 50 km southeast of Naples and 280 km southeast of Rome, accessible via Amalfi or Salerno. From <strong>Naples International Airport</strong> (65 km) or <strong>Rome Fiumicino Airport</strong> (300 km), trains to Salerno (30 minutes from Naples, €5; 2.5 hours from Rome, €20–€40) connect to buses or ferries to Amalfi (40 minutes, €3–€10), then a short bus ride to Praiano (10 minutes, €2) <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>. The nearest train station, Salerno (25 km), requires a bus or taxi (€30) to Praiano’s historic center <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Driving via the A3 motorway to Vietri sul Mare, then SS163 to Praiano, takes 1 hour from Naples, with limited parking near Piazza San Luca (€3/hour due to scarce space) <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The historic center is compact and walkable, with Chiesa di San Luca, Torre a Mare, and Piazza San Gennaro within 300 meters. Bicycles (€8/hour), rentable in Amalfi, are ideal for exploring the coast, with trails to Furore <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. The Via Francigena del Sud offers pilgrimage routes, with San Luca a minor stop <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

Ferries from Amalfi connect to Capri and Sorrento, with fares at €15–€20, enhancing coastal exploration <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
