<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Naples’ history spans over 2,800 years, rooted in its founding as a Greek colony. Established around the 8th century BC by settlers from Cumae as *Parthenope*, Naples (later *Neapolis*, meaning new city) became a major Greek center, with remnants like the Greek walls in Piazza Bellini <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Under Roman rule from the 4th century BC, Naples thrived as a cultural hub, with villas and theaters along the Bay of Naples.</p>

    <p>By the 6th century AD, Naples was a Byzantine stronghold, resisting barbarian invasions. The 13th century saw the construction of Castel Nuovo under the Angevins, marking Naples as the capital of the Kingdom of Naples <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought cultural flourishing, with the Palazzo Reale and artworks by Caravaggio. The 17th century saw Spanish rule, with Baroque additions to churches like San Gennaro. The 18th century marked the Bourbon era, with the construction of Teatro di San Carlo, Europe’s oldest opera house <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 19th century saw Naples join unified Italy in 1860, becoming a cultural and industrial hub. The 20th century brought challenges, with World War II bombings damaging the historic center, followed by reconstruction. The 1980 Irpinia earthquake caused minor damage, repaired by 1990. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Napoli Pizza Village and UNESCO designation for the historic center in 1995, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent excavations in Spaccanapoli have uncovered Greek and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Naples’ historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Greek colony to cultural capital, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Naples’ historical narrative is further enriched by its role as a Mediterranean crossroads. The Angevin and Aragonese periods left castles like <strong>Castel dell’Ovo</strong>, while the Bourbon era shaped the city’s urban landscape with grand boulevards like Via Toledo. The 19th-century cholera epidemics spurred modernization, with the construction of the Galleria Umberto I. Naples’ resilience through wars and natural disasters, combined with its preservation of ancient and Baroque heritage, makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>
