<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Ravello’s history spans over 1,500 years, rooted in its strategic position above the Amalfi Coast. Founded in the 5th century AD by Roman refugees fleeing barbarian invasions, Ravello (named *Rebellum*, meaning refuge) became a prosperous town under the Amalfi Maritime Republic by the 9th century. Its wealth, derived from trade with the Byzantine Empire and Islamic world, funded the construction of the Duomo di San Pantaleone and Villa Rufolo in the 11th and 13th centuries, respectively <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 12th century, Ravello was a key center of the Amalfi Republic, with noble families like the Rufolo building opulent villas. The Norman conquest in 1137 diminished Amalfi’s power, but Ravello retained its cultural significance. The 1343 tsunami damaged the coast, shifting the economy toward agriculture, particularly lemon groves <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Middle Ages saw Ravello flourish as a religious and artistic center, with frescoes and mosaics adorning churches <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with Ravello under Spanish rule. The 19th century saw Ravello join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture and early tourism, spurred by visits from Wagner and other luminaries. The 20th century marked a cultural renaissance, with the Ravello Festival, founded in 1953, attracting global audiences. The 1997 UNESCO World Heritage designation for the Amalfi Coast boosted tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. The 1953 earthquake caused minor damage to the Duomo, repaired by 1960. Recent archaeological digs near Villa Cimbrone have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in the Duomo’s museum, reinforcing Ravello’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Roman refuge to artistic haven, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Ravello’s historical narrative is further enriched by its role as a cultural crossroads. The Moorish influences in Villa Rufolo’s architecture reflect medieval trade with the Islamic world. The 14th century saw Ravello under the Angevin dynasty, with noble families commissioning artworks. The 19th century attracted European aristocrats during the Grand Tour, cementing Ravello’s reputation as a romantic retreat. Ravello’s preservation of its medieval villas and churches, combined with its modern cultural prominence, makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>

    <p>Ravello is 45 km southeast of Naples and 275 km southeast of Rome, accessible via Amalfi or Salerno. From <strong>Naples International Airport</strong> (65 km) or <strong>Rome Fiumicino Airport</strong> (300 km), trains to Salerno (30 minutes from Naples, €5; 2.5 hours from Rome, €20–€40) connect to buses to Amalfi (40 minutes, €3), then a short bus ride to Ravello (15 minutes, €2) <sup><a href="#cite-13">13</a></sup>. The nearest train station, Salerno (25 km), requires a bus or taxi (€30) to Ravello’s historic center <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-14">14</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Driving via the A3 motorway to Vietri sul Mare, then SS163 to Amalfi and SP1 to Ravello, takes 1 hour from Naples, with limited parking near Piazza Duomo (€3/hour due to scarce space) <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The historic center is compact and walkable, with Villa Rufolo, Duomo, and Piazza Vescovado within 300 meters. Bicycles (€8/hour), rentable in Amalfi, are ideal for exploring the coast, with trails to Minori <sup><a href="#cite-10">10</a></sup>. The Via Francigena del Sud offers pilgrimage routes, with the Duomo a key stop <sup><a href="#cite-8">8</a></sup>.</p>
