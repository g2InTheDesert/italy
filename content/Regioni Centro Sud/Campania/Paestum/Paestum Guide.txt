<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Paestum’s history spans over 2,700 years, rooted in its founding as a Greek colony. Established around 600 BC by Greek settlers from Sybaris, Paestum (originally *Poseidonia*, named after Poseidon) became a thriving city, with its Doric temples symbolizing religious and civic pride. Under Lucanian control in the 5th century BC, Paestum saw cultural flourishing, as evidenced by the Tomb of the Diver <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 3rd century BC, Paestum became a Roman colony (*Paestum*), thriving along the Via Appia with a forum, amphitheater, and aqueduct. The decline of the Roman Empire in the 4th century AD led to its abandonment due to malaria from nearby marshes. By the 9th century, Paestum was rediscovered by Christian settlers, with churches like the Chiesa dell’Annunziata built nearby <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Middle Ages saw Paestum’s temples repurposed as Christian sites, while the surrounding area supported agriculture under the Duchy of Naples <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought modest interest, with Paestum’s rediscovery by European scholars in the 18th century sparking the Grand Tour. The 19th century saw Paestum join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on farming and early tourism. The 20th century brought archaeological excavations, with the temples fully uncovered by the 1950s. The 1980 Irpinia earthquake caused minor damage, repaired by 1990. Paestum’s UNESCO designation in 1998 boosted tourism <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent excavations near the Temple of Neptune have uncovered Greek artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Paestum’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Greek colony to archaeological gem, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Paestum’s historical narrative is further enriched by its role as a cultural crossroads. The Lucanian period left vibrant frescoes, while Roman urban planning shaped the city’s layout. The Middle Ages saw the rise of Capaccio as a feudal center, with the Santuario della Madonna del Granato becoming a pilgrimage site. The 18th-century rediscovery by archaeologists like Johann Joachim Winckelmann sparked global interest, cementing Paestum’s status as a classical heritage site. Paestum’s preservation of its temples and artifacts makes it a living testament to Campania’s history.</p>
