<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Gagliano Castelferrato’s history spans over 2,000 years, rooted in its strategic hilltop position in the Nebrodi Mountains. Likely settled by the Sicani around the 8th century BC, Gagliano (possibly derived from *Gallianum*, meaning place of roosters) was a fortified outpost, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs evidencing early habitation <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-18">18</a></sup>. Under Greek rule in the 5th century BC, Gagliano was a minor settlement linked to the city-state of Agyrion (modern Agira).</p>

    <p>By the 3rd century BC, Gagliano came under Roman control, serving as an agricultural hub supplying grain to Sicily’s coastal cities. The Arab period (9th–11th centuries) saw Gagliano fortified as a defensive stronghold, with irrigation systems enhancing agriculture <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Normans conquered the area in the 11th century, building the Castello di Gagliano under Roger I, which became a feudal center under the Castelferrato family. The Middle Ages saw Gagliano thrive as a wheat and olive-producing village, with the Chiesa Madre built in the 15th century <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought modest prosperity, with frescoes adorning churches. The 19th century saw Gagliano join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture and pastoralism. The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration due to economic decline. The 1968 Belice earthquake caused minor damage to the castle, repaired by 1980. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Sagra del Pistacchio e del Grano and regional promotion of the Nebrodi Mountains, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the castle have uncovered Sicani and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico, reinforcing Gagliano’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Sicani settlement to medieval village, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Gagliano’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a rural stronghold. The Arab period introduced almond and pistachio cultivation, still central to the local economy. The Norman era left architectural marks like the castle’s towers, while the Spanish period (16th–18th centuries) saw the construction of noble residences like Palazzo Zappalà. The 19th-century Risorgimento saw Gagliano as a minor revolutionary hub. Gagliano’s preservation of its medieval structures and rural traditions makes it a living testament to Sicily’s layered history.</p>
