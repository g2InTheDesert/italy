<p>Gagliano Castelferrato, a medieval hilltop village in Sicily’s Enna province, embodies rustic charm amid rugged landscapes. Perched at 700 meters, its stone houses and Norman castle ruins offer panoramic views of Mount Etna. The Chiesa Madre, dedicated to San Cataldo, anchors the historic center, while local festivals celebrate Sicilian traditions. Known for its olive oil and almonds, Gagliano’s slow-paced life and authentic cuisine, like pasta with wild fennel, attract visitors seeking an off-the-beaten-path glimpse into Sicily’s heartland.</p>
