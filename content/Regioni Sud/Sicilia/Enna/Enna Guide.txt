<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Enna’s history spans over 3,000 years, rooted in its strategic position as a fortified hilltop settlement. Founded around the 10th century BC by the Sicani, Enna (known as *Henna*) was a sacred site linked to the cult of Demeter and Persephone. Greek settlers colonized it in the 7th century BC, making it a key city-state, with archaeological finds like the Morgantina silver hoard evidencing its prosperity <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Under Roman rule from the 3rd century BC, Enna was a grain-producing hub, with Cicero describing it as Sicily’s agricultural heart.</p>

    <p>By the 9th century, Enna was under Arab control, renamed *Qasr Yannah*, with its fortress strengthened. The Normans conquered Enna in the 11th century, building the Castello di Lombardia and the Cattedrale. The Middle Ages saw Enna thrive under Swabian and Aragonese rule, with Frederick II fortifying the city <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with the University of Enna (now Kore University) established in the 15th century. The 1693 earthquake damaged the city, prompting Baroque reconstructions like the Cattedrale’s facade <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 19th century saw Enna join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture and sulfur mining. The 20th century brought challenges, with World War II sparing major damage but economic decline prompting emigration. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Festa di Maria Santissima and regional autonomy, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent excavations near Lake Pergusa have uncovered Greek and Roman artifacts, displayed in the Museo Archeologico, reinforcing Enna’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Sicani settlement to medieval stronghold, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Enna’s historical narrative is enriched by its mythological and strategic importance. The <strong>Rocca di Cerere</strong>, a rocky outcrop near the Castello, was a sacred site for Demeter worship. The Arab period left influences in cuisine and irrigation systems, while the Norman era produced architectural gems like the Torre di Federico. The 19th-century Risorgimento saw Enna as a revolutionary hub. Enna’s preservation of its medieval and mythological heritage makes it a living testament to Sicily’s layered history.</p>
