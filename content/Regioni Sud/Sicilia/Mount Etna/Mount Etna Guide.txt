<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>The Mount Etna area’s history spans over 3,000 years, rooted in its volcanic and strategic significance. Settled by the Sicani around the 10th century BC, the area was revered as a sacred site, with Mount Etna considered the forge of Hephaestus in Greek mythology <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Greek settlers colonized the region in the 8th century BC, founding settlements like Katane (modern Catania), with Etna’s fertile slopes supporting agriculture and viticulture. Archaeological finds, such as pottery near Zafferana Etnea, evidence early habitation <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Under Roman rule from the 3rd century BC, the Etna area was a key agricultural hub, producing grain and wine for export. The Byzantine period (6th–9th centuries) saw the construction of early Christian churches, such as the Chiesa di Santa Maria in Zafferana Etnea. The Arab period (9th–11th centuries) introduced advanced irrigation systems, enhancing viticulture and introducing crops like pistachios <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The Normans in the 11th century built fortifications and churches, such as the Basilica di Santa Maria in Randazzo, shaping the area’s medieval character <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Renaissance brought prosperity, with Etna’s wine gaining fame across Europe. The catastrophic 1669 eruption of Mount Etna devastated Catania and nearby villages, reshaping the landscape and prompting Baroque reconstructions. The 19th century saw the Etna area join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy driven by agriculture, particularly wine and pistachios, and sulfur mining. The 1928 eruption destroyed villages like Mascali, leading to significant rebuilding efforts. Post-war tourism initiatives, including Mount Etna’s designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological excavations near Nicolosi have uncovered Greek and Roman artifacts, displayed in Catania’s Museo Civico Castello Ursino, reinforcing the area’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Sicani reverence to volcanic resilience, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>The Etna area’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a cultural and agricultural crossroads. The Arab period introduced almond and pistachio cultivation, which remain central to the local economy. The Spanish period (16th–18th centuries) saw the construction of noble estates, such as Palazzo Musmeci in Bronte, reflecting feudal prosperity. The 19th-century Risorgimento saw the Etna area as a minor revolutionary hub, with local uprisings contributing to Italian unification. The 20th century brought further volcanic activity, with eruptions shaping the region’s identity and tourism appeal. The area’s preservation of its volcanic landscapes, medieval villages, and agricultural traditions makes it a living testament to Sicily’s layered history.</p>
