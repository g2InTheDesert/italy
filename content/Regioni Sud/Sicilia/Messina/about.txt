<p>Messina, Sicily’s gateway to the mainland, sits on the strategic Strait of Messina, blending maritime history with resilient charm. Its Norman Duomo, with its astronomical clock, and the Madonna della Lettera statue are iconic, while the Regional Museum houses Caravaggio masterpieces. Rebuilt after a devastating 1908 earthquake, Messina’s wide boulevards contrast with its historic sanctuaries like Cristo Re. Known for swordfish dishes and granita, Messina offers a blend of scenic harbor views, cultural treasures, and Sicilian hospitality.</p>
