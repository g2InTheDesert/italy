<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Messina’s history spans over 2,700 years, rooted in its founding as a Greek colony. Established around 757 BC by Chalcidian Greeks as *Zancle* (meaning sickle, after the harbor’s shape), Messina became a major trading hub, with its port facilitating commerce across the Mediterranean <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Under Roman rule from the 3rd century BC, Messina (*Messana*) thrived, with structures like the Roman necropolis near the port. The Byzantine era in the 6th century AD saw Messina become a key stronghold, with the Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta built in the 12th century under Norman rule <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The Middle Ages saw Messina flourish under Aragonese and Spanish rule, with the construction of fortifications like Forte Gonzaga. The 16th century brought Renaissance art, with works by Antonello da Messina shaping European painting. The 1783 and 1908 earthquakes devastated the city, with the latter killing over 80,000 and prompting a Baroque and Art Nouveau reconstruction. The 19th century saw Messina join unified Italy in 1860, with its port driving economic growth <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 20th century brought challenges, with World War II bombings damaging the historic center, followed by reconstruction. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Festa della Madonna della Lettera and UNESCO recognition for its Norman architecture, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent excavations near the port have uncovered Greek and Roman artifacts, displayed in the MuMe, reinforcing Messina’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Greek colony to resilient port city, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Messina’s historical narrative is enriched by its role as a Mediterranean crossroads. The Arab period (9th–11th centuries) left influences in cuisine and architecture, while the Norman era produced landmarks like the Chiesa dei Catalani. The 1908 earthquake reshaped the city’s skyline, with Art Nouveau buildings like Palazzo dello Zodiaco. Messina’s port, a key link to mainland Italy, facilitated cultural exchanges with Calabria. Messina’s preservation of its Norman and Baroque heritage makes it a living testament to Sicily’s layered history.</p>
