<p>Leonforte, a baroque town in Sicily’s Enna province, is famed for its golden peaches and historic elegance. Founded in the 17th century, its Granfonte, a monumental fountain with 24 spouts, and the Palazzo Branciforti reflect its noble past. The Chiesa Madre di San Giuseppe anchors the town, while rolling hills produce olive oil and wine. Leonforte’s September peach festival draws crowds, and its quiet streets offer an authentic Sicilian experience, perfect for travelers seeking cultural immersion away from tourist hubs.</p>
