<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Leonforte’s history spans over 2,000 years, rooted in its strategic position in the Erei Mountains. Likely settled by the Sicani around the 8th century BC, Leonforte (named after the lion on the Branciforti family crest) was a minor outpost, with archaeological finds like pottery and tombs evidencing early habitation <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Under Greek rule in the 5th century BC, it was linked to the city-state of Agyrion (modern Agira), serving as an agricultural hub.</p>

    <p>By the 3rd century BC, Leonforte came under Roman control, supplying grain to coastal cities. The Arab period (9th–11th centuries) introduced advanced irrigation, enhancing agriculture <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. The town was officially founded in 1610 by Nicolò Placido Branciforti, who built the Palazzo Branciforti and Granfonte to establish a feudal stronghold. The 17th century saw Leonforte flourish under Spanish rule, with the Cattedrale di San Giovanni Battista built as a religious center <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>The 19th century saw Leonforte join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy relying on agriculture, particularly wheat and peaches. The 20th century brought challenges, with emigration due to economic decline. The 1968 Belice earthquake caused minor damage to the cathedral, repaired by 1980. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Sagra della Pesca and regional promotion of the Erei Mountains, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent archaeological digs near the Granfonte have uncovered Roman artifacts, displayed in a small local museum, reinforcing Leonforte’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Sicani settlement to Baroque village, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Leonforte’s historical narrative is enriched by its feudal and agricultural legacy. The Branciforti family shaped the town’s urban layout, with the Palazzo and Granfonte as symbols of prosperity. The Arab period introduced almond and peach cultivation, still central to the local economy. The Spanish period left architectural marks like the Chiesa di Santa Maria. Leonforte’s role in the Risorgimento was modest, but its preservation of Baroque structures and rural traditions makes it a living testament to Sicily’s layered history.</p>
