<section id="history" class="guide-section">
    <h2 class="guide-section-header">History</h2>
    
    <p>Catania’s history spans over 2,700 years, rooted in its founding as a Greek colony. Established in 729 BC by Chalcidian Greeks as *Katane*, Catania became a major trading hub, with its agora near the Teatro Greco-Romano <sup><a href="#cite-6">6</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>. Under Roman rule from the 3rd century BC, Catania thrived, with structures like the Anfiteatro Romano built in the 2nd century AD. The eruption of Mount Etna in 1669 and the 1693 earthquake devastated the city, leading to its Baroque reconstruction by architects like Vaccarini <sup><a href="#cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>By the 8th century, Catania was under Byzantine control, followed by Arab rule in the 9th century, leaving influences in its cuisine and street layout. The Normans conquered Catania in the 11th century, building the Cattedrale di Sant’Agata. The Middle Ages saw Catania flourish under Aragonese rule, with the Castello Ursino, built in the 13th century, serving as a royal stronghold <sup><a href="#cite-3">3</a></sup>. The Renaissance brought cultural growth, with the University of Catania, founded in 1434, becoming a scholarly hub.</p>

    <p>The 19th century saw Catania join unified Italy in 1860, with its economy driven by trade and citrus exports. The 20th century brought challenges, with World War II bombings damaging the historic center, followed by reconstruction. Post-war tourism initiatives, including the Festa di Sant’Agata and UNESCO designation for its Baroque architecture in 2002, revitalized the economy <sup><a href="#cite-5">5</a></sup>. Recent excavations near the Anfiteatro Romano have uncovered Greek artifacts, displayed in the Museo Civico Castello Ursino, reinforcing Catania’s historical legacy <sup><a href="#cite-7">7</a></sup>. Its history, from Greek colony to Baroque city, underscores its enduring significance.</p>

    <p>Catania’s historical narrative is further enriched by its resilience against natural disasters. The 1693 earthquake prompted a citywide Baroque redesign, creating landmarks like Piazza Duomo’s <strong>Fontana dell’Elefante</strong>, a lava stone symbol of rebirth. The 19th-century opera tradition, led by Bellini, elevated Catania’s cultural status. The city’s port, a key Mediterranean hub, facilitated trade with North Africa and the Levant. Catania’s preservation of its Greek, Roman, and Baroque heritage makes it a living testament to Sicily’s layered history.</p>
