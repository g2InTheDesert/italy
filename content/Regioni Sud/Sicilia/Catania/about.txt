<p>Catania, Sicily’s second-largest city, thrives at Mount Etna’s base, blending baroque splendor with urban grit. Its UNESCO-listed historic center, rebuilt in black lava stone after a 1693 earthquake, features the grand Piazza del Duomo and the Fontana dell’Elefante. Via Etnea, lined with shops and cafes, leads to Etna’s silhouette. The vibrant fish market, La Pescheria, and street foods like arancini showcase Sicilian flavors. Catania’s lively nightlife, historic depth, and proximity to Etna make it a dynamic coastal hub.</p>
